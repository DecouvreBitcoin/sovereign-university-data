(If you're just lost on GitHub, visit our [website](https://Plan₿.network/) to learn more about Bitcoin).

Assuming you're here to contribute, I will detail the inner workings of the content management and how you can assist us -- either by producing new content or translating/reviewing content in your language.

Thank you for your time, involvement, and effort in this project. Here we believe in a [value-for-value model](https://dergigi.com/2021/12/30/the-freedom-of-value/) and we'll do our best to reciprocate for your contribution based on your Proof-of-Work. Moreover, by participating in creating valuable Bitcoin resources for your local community, tips from them could also come your way.

# Why we do it ?

Plan ₿ Network is born from our belief in the transformative power of Bitcoin to create a decentralized future. We are inspired by the Cypherpunk Manifesto, which emphasizes the importance of knowledge as the foundation of freedom and change. Our ultimate goal is to empower individuals all over the world with the knowledge they have been deprived of, to revolutionize the world.

# How it works ?

Plan ₿ Network helps communities worldwide get organized to provide better education. The platform develops the necessary tools to achieve this goal through the [online academy](https://planb.network/en/courses), the [tutorials portal](https://planb.network/en/tutorials), and the [resource portal](https://planb.network/en/resources).

But contents are firstly published here in this repository, as a central public
place for Bitcoin Education. Any piece of content is specifically formatted to
facilitate the data parsing and (so) rendering on websites or apps.

## Repository Structure

This repo is organized around three main directories, which are:

- `courses`: comprising all the courses about Bitcoin, Lightning, Cryptography, Mining, and so on.
- `resources`: consisting of various types of resources about Bitcoin, such as books, company info, or podcasts.
- `tutorials`: consisting of how-to articles, categorized into themes like exchange, merchant, node, privacy, and so on.

Each individual content piece, which is a markdown file, is defined by its location in this tree structure and by its language in the name. For instance, the Italian tutorial about Nerd-Miner would have the following path:

```
./sovereign-university-data/tutorials/mining/nerd-miner/it.md
```

If you want to learn more about our repo structure and content format, check out our [documentation](./docs/README.md).

If you want to have a bird-eye view of published contents and proposals, check
out:

- the [Course Dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/DecouvreBitcoin/projects/3/views/1)
- the [Tutorial Dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/DecouvreBitcoin/projects/5)
- the [Resources Dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/DecouvreBitcoin/projects/6)

## Incentive model: Value-4-Value

We believe in the power of Proof Of Work and how this enables a value-4-value model. In the words of one of the greatest poets of our times DerGigi we consider time, talent and treasure. Which means we are commited to providing back to those who enrich us with their time and talent.

In practical terms, it means that any task (content creation, peer-reviewing,
proofreading), explicited as individual Github issue, would have a
reward in sats attached to it. And when the issue would be closed, the reward
would be sent to the contributor who completed the task.
