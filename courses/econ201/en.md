# A journey into economics

Welcome to Théo Mogenet's course! Passionate about economics, history, literature, political science, and technology, he has decided to share his knowledge of Austrian economics with you. This branch, less known in economics, is based on human rationality and free actor behavior. Less intense in mathematics, it is a question of logic and social study above all.

This school of thought has already had several centuries behind it and has a whole panorama of authors, thoughts, and economists behind it. Great names in economics such as Hayek, Rothbard, Mises, Bastiat, or Menger have long defended this movement. In contrast to the omnipresent Keynesianism of our day, the Austrian school puts the individual back at the center of the equation with a more liberal, capitalist, and even anarchist approach.

Hello everyone and welcome to Econ 201: Introduction to Austrian Economics.

In this course offered by Théomogenes, you will discover this branch of economics that differs greatly from Keynesian doctrine. Until now, you may have learned that the production and management of money were the responsibility of central banks, with the idea that monetary printing and spending promote growth. However, there is another school of economic thought: Austrian economics. With over 200 years of research and development, philosophical reflections, and writings by renowned authors, this approach emphasizes a more sober vision of growth and human rationality in our economy.

In reality, economics is an extremely social and complex field, composed of a myriad of interconnected small actors who together contribute to forming a coherent whole. Rather than approaching this discipline through mathematical equations, we must understand it from the perspective of human logic and sociology. In this course, we will explore the fundamental concepts of Austrian economics. Your instructor, Théomo Jeunet, is a passionate and competent professor of Austrian economics.
To start, we offer you a bonus video that will explain how our current financial system works. You will discover how commercial banks and central banks interact and drive the economy. We will address the major players in our financial world and how this centralization of power among certain economic institutions can lead to abuses and financial crises.

In the second part of this course, we will examine the difference between Keynesianism and Austrian economics, exploring their respective schools of thought, methods of reflection, and tools they use to establish economic truth. We will also study the formation of economic crises. Is it due to human incompetence, market manipulation, or collective euphoria of people? We will explore how our cycles of growth, decline, recession, and golden age are created by human emotions.

Finally, in the third part of this course, I will conduct an open interview with Théo, during which we will discuss many topics in macroeconomics, geopolitics, and economics in general. We will ask questions such as: Can a world survive solely on Bitcoin? Is an economic and financial system based on Austrian thought viable? Do negative interest rates not promote pollution, overconsumption, and depletion of Earth's resources?

This course will be a combination of economics and philosophy, with an open discussion between Théo and myself. If you have any questions during this course, do not hesitate to ask them in our Discord, which you will find the link to in the description.

I warmly thank Théo for producing this course, and I hope he will be an excellent teacher for you. We had a lot of fun creating this content. This course is accessible to everyone and will, I think, be essential to follow our future more in-depth courses on economics. This course will lay the necessary foundations to explore certain economic theories in more detail that we will only briefly touch on here.

If you are ready to embark on this adventure, I invite you to click on the following video and start with the bonus video on our current financial system. I now give the floor to Théo. Thank you to him for collaborating with Descoupes Bitcoin for the realization of this video. I will see you very soon. Goodbye!

# Money creation by commercial banks

![Explanation of the traditional banking system](https://youtu.be/pz0RxlXNs7Y)

Welcome to this exploration of money creation by commercial banks.

We know that money is central to our economy, but do you really know where it comes from? This is where commercial banks come in. In fact, most of the money in our economy is created by these institutions.

How does it happen? Well, when a bank extends credit, it creates money. It's an accounting process that essentially takes place in the electronic world. For example, when you make a payment to someone who has an account with another bank, there is an exchange of central bank reserve money between the banks. This money is "held" in the banking system.

Thus, much of the money we use every day is purely electronic, circulating from one bank to another. Around 95% of money is created in this way by commercial banks, through transactions such as transfers, credit transfers and card payments. This doesn't mean that banks don't hold any reserves. They do, but on average, the reserve ratio is only around 1 to 2% of the quantity of money circulating in the economy. These reserves are classified according to different monetary aggregates (M0, M1, M2) which correspond to different layers of money creation.

And what if everyone suddenly decides to withdraw their money? In such a case of mass withdrawal, banks might not have enough base money to pay their customers. Of course, commercial banks have large reserves on their balance sheets that would enable them to create a lot of money, but they refrain from doing so because they risk losing their profits if loans are not repaid. Bank profitability is largely determined by the difference between the cost of short-term borrowing and the cost of long-term lending. Banks can borrow funds from other banks or the central bank at short-term rates, then lend long-term at higher rates. It is this difference that enables them to make a profit.

Now that we have a clear understanding of money creation by commercial banks, let's dive into the effect of quantitative easing (QE) on the economy and banks. QE policies have the effect of lowering interest rates and flattening the yield curve. This has a significant impact on the profitability of banks, which are less inclined to take risks and prefer to lend to customers offering collateral.
The QE, in simple terms, is when central banks buy debt securities. Anticipating these purchases, commercial banks hold onto these securities, knowing that they will be bought back later by the central bank. However, the currency created during these QE operations does not circulate in the real economy. It is a kind of "ghost" currency that cannot be used for purchases or to pay taxes. Banks use this currency to settle their mutual debts.

It is important to note that monetary creation can have various effects on inflation, depending on whether it is asset inflation or consumer product inflation. This is where the principle of the Cantillon effect comes into play. This effect is related to the circulation of money and means that bankers benefit from monetary creation before inflation manifests itself. A flattened yield curve induced by QE can hinder bank profitability and discourage them from taking risks. Understanding the dynamics of quantitative easing is crucial to understanding its impact on the economy and banks.

After discussing the impacts of monetary creation by commercial banks and quantitative easing, let us turn our attention to alternatives to this traditional approach. Bitcoin is a notable example. One solution could lie in the adoption of market-based interest rates, rather than those imposed by a central bank. A steeper yield curve encourages banks to financially support entrepreneurs, thus promoting capital accumulation and innovation. Conversely, a very flattened yield curve only benefits those who already own assets, allowing for enrichment without real value creation.

In the current economic context, business leaders are often more inclined to meet shareholder expectations than to invest in long-term projects aimed at creating capital. One solution to this impasse could be to promote "creative destruction". Central bankers may, however, encounter political difficulties in accepting the idea of letting people fail by raising rates. One solution could be to shift attention away from the euro and the dollar and focus on a more resilient standard, such as Bitcoin. Indeed, Bitcoin could be the peaceful way out of this situation.

Money is the perfect example of a good benefiting from the network effect. Historically, there has always been a monetary standard. Nick Batia's book "Layered Money" provides an excellent introduction to understanding the functioning of the banking system.
In summary, understanding monetary creation by commercial banks, the impact of quantitative easing on the economy and banks, as well as alternatives like Bitcoin, is crucial. Money, as a network effect good par excellence, requires a deep understanding of the banking system to approach these issues in an informed manner. Thank you for your attention.

# Introduction to Austrian Economics

![Introduction to Austrian Economics](https://youtu.be/ZSDCepNNacI)

The Austrian School of Economics is undoubtedly one of the most captivating schools of thought in economics. Its methodology, both coherent and nuanced, generates relevant and applicable conclusions in our economic reality. This approach is particularly enlightening for understanding the economic role of Bitcoin.

However, documentation in French on the Austrian School of Economics remains relatively limited. French economists such as Bastia and Pascal Salin have stood out as pioneers of this school of thought. Their contributions have greatly helped to promote and disseminate these ideas in France.

The Austrian School of Economics is distinguished by its specific methodology, setting it apart from other schools of economics. It applies an axiomatic-aprioristic methodology, inspired by mathematics and philosophy. Axioms are statements that are both obvious and indemonstrable. Logic is then used to deduce more complex statements.

The theory of value is fundamental in the Austrian School of Economics, a notion that greatly differentiates it from conventional economics, particularly on this theory of value. Bitcoin could be considered as the first layer of any economic theory. Various theories attempt to explain how the value of an object is determined, including the theory of intrinsic value, subjective value, labor value, or even land value. Physiocrats, for example, believed that value essentially came from the land. Adam Smith, on the other hand, believed that value depended on the labor required to create a good.
In the 19th century, the labor theory of value was conceptualized by economists such as Smith, Ricardo, and Marx. Around the 1870s, a true theoretical revolution took place in economics, with the abandonment of the labor theory of value in favor of the marginal theory of value. William Stanley Jevons, Léon Walras, and Karl Menger developed this theory of marginal value, postulating that value emanates from the price that an individual is willing to pay for an additional unit of a good or service on the market. Value therefore arises from demand, either from a person's desire for a good and their willingness to acquire it through an exchange. Karl Menger distinguished himself from his contemporaries by suggesting that value is subjective, and that goods have no intrinsic value. According to him, value must manifest itself through the market and the formation of prices. For Menger, value and prices are inseparable.

# The Austrian School's View of Money

![Money](https://youtu.be/Dt8ounex2jg)

The Austrian perception of money is intrinsically linked to the Austrian school of economic thought, which emphasizes large-scale division of labor. However, our ability to remember complex interactions with a large number of individuals is limited, as evidenced by Dunbar's psychological limit of 150 to 250 people for remembering interactions and relationships. This is where money comes in, as it is used for indirect exchanges between tribes and to establish trust in transactions with people outside our family circle. Money therefore allows for the extension of the division of labor to individuals with whom we may not necessarily have a direct trust capacity. Austrians, such as Ludwig von Mises, argue that the fundamental reason we need money is the uncertainty of the future.

The double coincidence of desires poses a problem for bartering, and Mises proposes a thought experiment to show that money is not necessary if the future is known. Money serves to counter the uncertainty of our future needs and serves not only for exchange today but also for exchange tomorrow. A currency must be accepted with certainty by others because it is a socially accepted institution. To be used as a social tool, money must have properties such as durability, verifiability, divisibility, fungibility, and resistance to censorship. Non-fungible goods do not work as money. Banknotes and coins have different denominations to allow for divisibility. A currency must be resistant to censorship and not require trust or credit. Different currencies do not have the same reputation, which can affect their social acceptance. The properties sought in a currency directly reflect the need to be able to transact with as many people as possible. A currency must be scarce to prevent its value from being based solely on its utility. Scarcity is the most important property of money because it cannot be easily reproduced. In history, the hardest currency (the one with the most inelastic supply) has always prevailed. The future supply of gold will be lower than the future supply of silver, which means that the relative price of gold to silver will be higher.

To be accepted, currency must have objective and fundamental characteristics, and the characteristics of good currency include divisibility, portability, verifiability, fungibility, durability, resistance to censorship, established history, marketability, and scarcity. Gold has become a currency throughout history due to its chemical properties that make it a perfect store of value, but it is not practical for other functions of currency (divisibility, transport, purity verification). A layer of credit currency was therefore added to gold to compensate for its limitations, and bills of exchange and certificates of deposit emerged as fiduciary instruments to facilitate transactions without having to transport gold. People used these pieces of paper as currency instead of exchanging them for gold, and precious metals gradually disappeared from circulation. Currency must be something that is not fiduciary and does not need to trust someone to be used, as it has purchasing power, meaning it is the only thing unanimously accepted to extinguish a debt. However, currency has not always been a debt, as the need to use something more divisible and portable introduced the possibility of a fractional reserve system, which is a limitation of available technological means.

In a standard financial system based on Bitcoin, there is no reason for institutions to issue pieces of paper backed by Bitcoins. Bitcoin is more divisible, portable, and easily verifiable than a fractional reserve. Gold had defects such as the limited spatial marketability and divisibility, which Bitcoin does not have. Bitcoin is therefore a technological solution to the limitations of traditional currency and the competition of currencies in the world of tomorrow.

![FAQ on currency](https://youtu.be/TcpCtz-bXZs)

In any society, currency plays a crucial role in commercial exchanges and savings. With the emergence of Bitcoin, a new form of currency has emerged, creating competition with traditional fiduciary currencies. Contemporary economists have sought to regulate economic cycles through interest rates, but the adoption of Bitcoin as a monetary standard questions this practice.

### Gresham's Law and the Consequences of Government Regulation on Cryptocurrencies

Gresham's Law, which states that "bad money drives out good," is well-known in economics. However, it primarily applies in the context of legal tender. When the government imposes a lower quality currency to finance itself without costs, it can cause capital flight and currency overvaluation. Governments may seek to regulate cryptocurrencies, but this approach can also harm the adoption and use of Bitcoin.

Periods of financial repression have often led to increased adoption of Bitcoin. However, users must be aware of the risks associated with holding their bitcoins with custodians rather than managing their own self-custody. Rockpools can be used to raise awareness among users about the importance of self-custody and holding their own keys, in anticipation of increased financial repression. Governments may risk banning the use of cryptocurrencies to maintain control over capital transfers. Therefore, users must educate themselves on techniques such as transaction mixing and coin joins to use Bitcoin effectively.

# Economic Cycles

![Economic Cycles for the Austrian School](https://youtu.be/CrPE6mcOjx4)

The theory of capital in the Austrian school of thought differs significantly from that of other economic schools. While other schools tend to consider capital in a uniform and homogeneous manner, Austrian economists distinguish between different types of capital, allowing for a richer understanding of production processes.

One distinctive element of the Austrian approach is the integration of time into economic processes, often neglected in other schools. Austrian economists present production as a sequential process that takes place in stages over time. A final good, such as a sandwich, is the result of many production stages involving different factors of production - wheat for bread, an oven for baking, stones from a quarry for building the oven, and so on. Each stage requires specific inputs, or "capital goods," which themselves result from earlier production stages.

This is where the Austrian theory of capital comes into play. Austrian economists emphasize that some factors of production, such as land and human labor, cannot be produced. These "original factors of production" are distinct from intermediate goods or capital goods that go into the production of other goods.
Prices play a crucial role in this temporal production structure. They coordinate interactions between individuals without the need for a central planner. Additionally, Austrian economists note that there can be multiple production structures to create the same good, some being more capital-intensive than others. This diversity reflects both the complexity of the real economic world and the importance of choice and flexibility in production processes.

The Austrian school proposes an explanation of economic cycles based on the temporal production structure and the role of interest rates. According to this perspective, individuals' time preferences - the subjective valuation of the future compared to the present - play a crucial role. Individuals generally have positive time preferences, meaning they demand compensation for deferring consumption over time.

Interest rates emerge as a mechanism to compensate for this deferral of consumption. It is determined by individuals' time preferences and serves to coordinate transactions between savers and entrepreneurs. The market interest rate is thus the result of the supply and demand for capital. Just as prices serve as information signals reflecting individual preferences, interest rates act as a signal of opportunity cost, helping individuals arbitrate between consumption and savings. These choices in consumption and savings, in turn, signal present and future demand for consumer goods.

Savings, in this context, are used to increase future production. Financial capital represents limited real resources. Investing in productive projects without having enough resources is wasteful and can mislead entrepreneurs, making them believe that there are more resources available than there actually are. Interest rates also play a key role in the temporal coordination of production. They send signals to entrepreneurs about the availability of resources over time, allowing for production detours to increase efficiency. These production detours create intermediate goods that are used to manufacture other goods, adding steps to the production structure.
However, artificial manipulation of interest rates can cause economic distortions. A decrease in interest rates can encourage entrepreneurs to undertake production detours without having saved the necessary resources, creating an impression of economic boom. In the long run, however, this leads to a decrease in prices due to the inconsistency between current consumption and the immobilization of resources for future production. Companies may end up with significant stocks, leading to bankruptcies, losses for other companies, and a domino effect in the economy. These instabilities are related to the fundamental contradiction between the finiteness of resources and the lack of sufficient savings to undertake investments requiring these resources. Savings are therefore essential to ensure future consumption of goods currently produced.

According to Austrian theory, the economic crisis symbolizes an unsustainable relative valuation between production goods and consumption goods, requiring a price readjustment. Several phases characterize the economic cycle from this Austrian perspective:

1. An initial expansion period allows for savings and leads to a decrease in interest rates.
2. This is followed by an investment boom without significant impact on the prices of consumer goods.
3. Once the investments are made, productivity increases, generating prosperity and a drop in consumer prices.
4. This period of prosperity can turn into euphoria, accompanied by an influx of credit that keeps interest rates low despite a savings deficit.
5. A phase of pure speculation emerges, disconnecting real and nominal returns.
6. The bursting of the financial bubble occurs when bankers stop the accelerated increase in the monetary mass.

Schumpeter named this deflationary process "creative destruction". The misallocation of capital must be corrected, leading to the bankruptcy of some entrepreneurs. A purge of excesses must be done, either through overinvestment or misallocation of capital. Once this purge process is complete, prices stabilize, savings are replenished, and interest rates naturally decrease, launching a new expansion phase.
However, the intervention of central bankers can disrupt this cycle. For years, they have reacted to financial bubbles by lowering interest rates and printing money, preventing any readjustment. In doing so, they sow the seeds of a future violent recession. Central bank monetary policies prevent the process of readjustment and creative destruction, which can lead to hyperinflation. The dilemma arises as to whether workers will allow the adjustment to occur or if central bankers will intervene at every sign of fragility.

Finally, the Austrian theory of economic cycles explains that the lowering of interest rates has led to overcapacity of production on a global scale. This overcapacity has led to downward pressure on prices, despite massive money creation. The Austrian school emphasizes the importance of savings and capital accumulation to increase long-term productivity. This is illustrated by the example of Robinson Crusoe, who sets aside a portion of his blueberry production to make a tool that will make him more productive. Savings are therefore necessary to invest in new tools or productive goods. In a more complex economy, specialization and division of labor also contribute to economic efficiency.

These principles are illustrated by the 2008 financial crisis, which was attributed to overproduction in the US housing market. Since this crisis, central banks have kept interest rates lower than real growth, thus improving their marginal return on capital. However, to compensate for risk, the interest rate must be equal to or slightly lower than long-term growth.

However, low interest rates can create a savings deficit and rapid devaluation of savings. As a result, economic agents may seek value reserves rather than savings. In addition, negative interest rates can create production capacity without future solvency, leading to intensive capital investments that cannot be finalized due to future solvency. Companies may then be left with stocks that they can only resell at greatly reduced prices.
According to the Austrian school, a readjustment of the productive structure is inevitable in such a situation, marked by intense overproduction. Politicians and central bankers may try to ensure that this readjustment manifests itself in different ways.
Typically, asset prices decrease relative to consumer goods when there is urgency for consumption compared to what is distant in the production structure. The price of consumer goods may slightly increase, while central bankers attempt to maintain the price of productive goods by fiat through printing money, supporting valuations, and keeping interest rates at zero or even lower levels. According to Austrian economic theory, central bankers have contributed to inflating the economic bubble rather than allowing the process of creative destruction. Additionally, overcapacity has been maintained and even created in other regions, notably in China. Debt-zombified entities have been kept afloat through loose monetary policy, allowing for overproduction capacity. Since 2012-2014, money has been primarily used for speculation and consumption, leading to a misallocation of capital.

In times of hyperinflation, it is difficult to regain confidence in a new currency. Historically, attempts have been made to recreate a currency based on land or property, but mistrust of institutions has often prevented assigning value to a new currency. Gold is universally considered a solid support for a currency, although the resources necessary to support the currency are often already depleted.

Restrictive measures were taken in Brazil during a period of hyperinflation, with blocked current accounts and limited withdrawals. This led to a loss of confidence in banks and investments in tangible assets such as used cars and landlines. This inflation forced people to borrow for everyday expenses, such as foreign travel. The effects of hyperinflation on Bitcoin have been discussed, including the transition between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. Despite money printing, the price of Bitcoin remains unpredictable, with a risk of short-term liquidity crises. The inability of central bankers to maintain stable monetary policy reinforces the idea that Bitcoin must become a safe haven asset rather than a speculative asset.

In developed countries, where currencies and investment alternatives are stable, Bitcoin is mostly held by people speculating on its future value. However, there is a trend towards accumulating Bitcoin in countries where financial pressures are stronger, such as Turkey or Argentina. In the future, we can expect controls on outgoing capital and more difficult channels to convert bitcoins into fiat currencies. Capital controls, which were the norm in the 20th century, could make a comeback in times of crisis, challenging the capital freedom we have known since the 1980s.

# The Impossibility of Economic Calculation in a Socialist System

![The Impossibility of Economic Calculation in a Socialist System](https://youtu.be/E-9Fl6eg-mo)

The idea of the impossibility of calculation in a socialist regime was introduced by Ludwig von Mises in the 1920s. Mises argued that the major challenge of resource allocation in a socialist economy is essentially related to the lack of information and knowledge in a system, even with a minimal degree of central planning.

The utopian vision of socialism considers it as an earthly paradise, but it does not propose practical solutions to achieve this ideal. In their time, utopian socialists were often mocked for their ideas deemed absurd. Scientific socialism, embodied by Marx and Engels, provides an explanation of capitalist dynamics that would inevitably lead to the downfall of this system. They believed that capitalism would be replaced by a socialist organization of society, which would do away with exchanges and market prices. The working classes would take control of the means of production, leading to collectivization. This planned organization of production and distribution would follow the principle "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."

In 1920, Mises wrote an article entitled "The Impossibility of Economic Calculation in a Socialist System," which later gave rise to a book entitled "Socialism." He argued that the absence of market prices makes it impossible to organize a complex economy.

In a free market system, prices guide actions to identify profit opportunities, mobilizing factors of production and generating products sold on the market. According to Ludwig von Mises, an economist of the Austrian school, prices transmit not only information but also knowledge, which can be interpreted at two levels: knowledge and information on the one hand, and prices on the other.
The Austrian school also examines the theory of capital, which studies how individuals establish different sequential production structures, composed of several stages involving different actors and factors of production. The relative prices of intermediate factors are adjusted according to future prices anticipated by the entrepreneur, who must calculate the necessary resources and commit funds to secure these factors of production.

In a primitive economy, several entrepreneurs may intervene in different stages of production, but the ultimate goal of the entrepreneur and the economy is the production of consumer goods. Prices are influenced by consumers' willingness to pay for a given good, while determinants of intermediate goods, such as transport trucks, metal, and land for hop cultivation, play a crucial role in the production of consumer products.

Competition among entrepreneurs drives them to use alternatives to produce intermediate goods, and the use of resources in a production activity is determined by marginal income. The prices of intermediate goods are set based on this competition.

Capitalism allows for a decentralized allocation of resources through a trial-and-error process, promoting collaboration and competition. Economic calculation plays an essential role in maximizing profits relative to costs.

In the absence of property rights, bankruptcy, profit, and loss, it is impossible to rationalize production. According to some economists of the Austrian school, top-down production can lead to waste and misallocation of resources. In a socialist system, some have proposed price adjustments through trial and error to balance supply and demand in the absence of market prices. However, this process does not solve the problem of allocating intermediate goods.

To solve this problem, it is necessary to understand consumers' preferences to know which use of a certain good has the most social value. It is also crucial to determine if there are other industries that could make more valued use of these resources. Solving this problem requires the participation of entrepreneurs who produce information by trying different combinations of intermediate goods to win the favor of consumers. Let's take the case of titanium, a limited resource. Its allocation must be organized in a decentralized manner through competition among entrepreneurs. If titanium is highly demanded by the aerospace industry, its high cost could discourage the automotive industry, which would then be forced to turn to other materials.

In addition, here are some practical examples of Austrian economic theory against socialism.

- The natural course of exchanges: the example of the pencil highlights the need for cooperation between different actors to produce a complex finished product. This case illustrates that it is impossible for a single person or organization to know all the necessary information to organize production in a complex world.
- Economic distortions: subsidies for corn in the United States cause surpluses that distort prices and have negative effects on health and the environment, such as the use of corn syrup instead of sugar.
- Economic dysfunctions: the example of China illustrates the case of rapid growth that eventually causes economic dysfunctions. China faces a significant shortage of fresh water. Resources are concentrated in the south, where only 40% of the population lives, while 60% of the agricultural land is in the north. This limits the production of factories that manufacture products such as iPhones and Tesla, which can lead to disruptions in supply chains and economies. The pricing of water for the past 40 years has led to water waste and pollution.
- Centralization and inefficiency: France, with its capitalist and socialist industrial sectors, presents an example of the irrationality of resource allocation by centralizing the management of certain sectors such as health and education. The French healthcare system is struggling with high healthcare spending, a struggling healthcare system, and low and declining levels of education. The numerus clausus policy, which sets the number of doctors to be trained, has also led to the importation of doctors from other countries.
- High-performing education systems: well-functioning healthcare systems have solidarity in healthcare and a market price system. Countries that excel in this area are in Southeast Asia and Switzerland. Similarly, the education system in Nordic countries with education vouchers is effective and allows for competition between schools. These countries are still among the top in the PISA rankings.

The absence of market prices for factors of production makes economic calculation impossible in planning future and past actions. A socialist management system of means does not work because it cannot know if the plans are the most appropriate to achieve the chosen ends. In addition, adjusting incentives by the state or central committees can create distortions and economic imbalances. Finally, the socialization of healthcare or education can encourage counterproductive behaviors, such as poor health or educational inefficiency.

## Austrian Economics and Free Markets

In an Austrian free market economy, economic crises could be less frequent and less severe. The market could adjust to reflect a price equilibrium consistent with resource availability. In such a system, there could be unemployment and deflation, but these conditions could eventually lead to an economic boom. In the event of an economic crisis, the market would adjust itself, without having to bail out banks or assets. Deflation, in this context, reveals the misallocation of capital during economic expansion, and a readjustment is necessary for sustainable economic growth.

To illustrate, one can make a comparison with a boat's course correction or a fever for the immune system. In both cases, an intervention to prevent the natural self-correction process could actually encourage a misallocation of resources. For example, an intervention to prevent economic crises could encourage a misallocation of capital. The consequences of artificial growth could prove more harmful than small local recessions, potentially leading to a risk of total social collapse in the absence of food reserves. Historical examples can be found in the USSR, Ukraine, and Germany.

In a free market economy, there would be no need for fractional reserves for bank loans. Loans would be directly linked to savers' savings, and interest rates would increase in the event of a lack of savings. Supply and demand would regulate the flow of savings and loans, and the cost of money would reflect the market in a system without fractional reserves. Direct equity investment would be preferred, resulting in less debt and better alignment of interests between the entrepreneur and the financier.

However, in this system, the concept of risk-free savings would no longer exist, as there would be no guaranteed return. To beat inflation, those who would not normally take risks would have to invest, which may not be synchronized with economic cycles. Savings would serve to protect against future uncertainty, while investment would involve operational and cyclical risk. In short, such an economy would value financial autonomy, avoiding dependence on the performance of large companies or the stock market to live decently through the money accumulated through work and savings.

# The Austrian Methodology

![the Austrian methodology](https://youtu.be/hMyYGwU76dI)
The Austrian school of economics distinguishes itself from other schools by its axiomatic-deductive methodology, which differs from the positivist approach often used in social sciences. The positivist approach is based on laws established from empirical data, adopting a method similar to that of physical sciences. It formulates hypotheses from observations, which are then confirmed or refuted by temporary experiments. The scientific method consists of retaining the hypothesis that best explains the data and continuing to explore it until a more precise hypothesis is found.

However, in social sciences, it is difficult to isolate variables as in physics, because each moment in history is unique and a multitude of factors come into play. Economic experiments cannot be reproduced in a laboratory, and it is important to note that observing a correlation between two variables does not prove a causal relationship between them. The Austrians, notably Ludwig von Mises, proposed an alternative method called the a priori or axiomatic-deductive method to study social sciences. This approach is based on fundamental propositions called axioms, similar to those used in mathematics. For example, Euclidean geometry is an example of an axiomatic-deductive method in the field of mathematics.

In Austrian economics, fundamental axioms include positive time preferences, which are based on individual choices of goods or services today rather than tomorrow, due to uncertainty about the future. These axioms are not questioned, as they are considered evident and consistent with everyday life. Using these basic axioms, Austrian economists use the rules of logic to derive statements that provide information about the functioning of economic phenomena. For example, they explain that economic crises are caused by an imbalance between savings and investment, which leads to artificial manipulation of interest rates. Individuals with positive time preferences demand a positive interest rate to compensate for the risk of lending. Austrians argue that valuation relationships are subjective, so interest rates can vary depending on individuals and circumstances.

Prices play a crucial role in the rational organization of individuals with partial information. The interest rate balances the supply and demand of capital in the market, thus promoting the economy. Austrian economists emphasize that arbitrarily setting the interest rate can lead to economic crises and make calculation impossible in a socialist regime.

## Austrian Economists and Methodological Differences

Austrian economists often encounter difficulties when debating with other schools of thought, as they do not use the same methods of analysis. While Austrians reason from fundamental axioms, such as the subjectivity of value, to deduce logical consequences, Keynesian or monetarist economists tend to rely on empirical data to establish general economic laws.

An example of methodological difference is the position of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) advocates who have advocated for money printing to achieve political goals, using the absence of inflation between 2008 and 2019 as an argument. Austrian economists and MMT advocates do not speak the same language and do not agree on the criteria for determining the validity of an economic law. This makes debates between these different schools difficult and often unproductive.

It is important to note that cherry-picking, which involves selectively choosing data to establish relationships between variables, is an unscientific and unrigorous method in economics. Monetary creation, for example, does not necessarily cause inflation, and a more nuanced approach is necessary to understand complex economic mechanisms. Axioms play a crucial role in Austrian economic reasoning. They are fundamental elements from which logical deductions can be made. However, it is important to recognize that precise forecasting of the future in economics is often difficult due to the complexity of economic phenomena and inherent uncertainty.

Methodology is an essential aspect in economics and in social sciences in general. It influences how questions are asked, hypotheses are formulated, and data is interpreted. Understanding the methodological differences between economic schools of thought can help us appreciate diverse perspectives and develop our own opinions on the topics discussed in previous episodes.

## Further Reading

To deepen your understanding of economic and social phenomena, particularly regarding Austrian economics, here are some book recommendations:

- "The Austrian School" by Ressus Huerta de Soto: This affordable book provides a comprehensive introduction to the evolution of Austrian economic thought, covering key concepts and theories.
- "Human Action" by Ludwig von Mises: Considered the magnum opus of the Austrian school, this work explores in-depth the theoretical foundations of human action and economics.
- "The Use of Knowledge in Society" by Friedrich Hayek: This short text examines how dispersed knowledge in society is used to guide economic decisions, highlighting the importance of prices and competition.
- Joseph Schumpeter's Nobel Prize acceptance speech in 1974: This speech provides an overview of Schumpeter's vision of entrepreneurship, innovation, and capitalism.
- "Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy" or "The Theory of Economic Development" by Joseph Schumpeter: These iconic books by Schumpeter explore the dynamics of capitalism, innovation, and economic cycles.

In addition to these readings, you can also find information on Austrian economics by exploring online resources. The Mises Institute, based in the southeastern United States, offers articles and videos by renowned economists. The Savedin Amoos Academy offers interactive seminars with distinguished guests, although this option is paid. In France, people like Yorick de Montbin, Fergan Aziri, and Richard Hamelin often share analyses and discussions on Austrian economics on different YouTube channels. Finally, the Bitcoin Institute can also be a source of information on the economic aspects related to Bitcoin.

By reading these works and exploring these online resources, you can develop a deeper understanding of the key principles and ideas of the Austrian school of economics.
