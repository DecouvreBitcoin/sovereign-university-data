# Introduction to BTC 102 training

Welcome to BTC 102! A practical course that will guide you in setting up your Bitcoin plan! Through this course, we will prepare to get your first bitcoins, secure them properly, and ensure a good entry into this new industry.

The bitcoin industry is still young and considered a constantly evolving phenomenon. Indeed, despite many years of trying to regulate this market, it remains extremely free due to the nature of its underlying protocol.

Due to this impossibility of being fully regulated, Bitcoin has been able to develop organically and decentralized for over 14 years. It is therefore an industry in full embryonic explosion and which only asks to continue to grow.

Explosions of innovations and possibilities inevitably mean scams, frauds, and risks. It goes without saying that your journey in Bitcoin will not be without setbacks or mistakes. However, to help you avoid them as much as possible, this training will serve as a practical guide to get started. The BTC 101 training, on the other hand, is more theoretical to understand how Bitcoin works.
In this course, we will focus on 4 angles:

- Reviewing the basics and prerequisites to ensure that you do not get scammed or lose your money foolishly.
- Fundamentally reviewing why Bitcoin is important and understanding its industry. This will strengthen our convictions and help us understand what we are getting into.
- Setting up your first Bitcoin wallet and your first purchase of bitcoins via an exchange platform. Here, we will look for the solution that best suits your needs.
- Finally, the last section will address a fundamental concept for your security, but too little explored in the industry: how to create a Bitcoin inheritance plan.

As you can see, this course is really designed to accompany you so that you respect the best practices of our industry from the beginning, in a simple and fast way!

Good luck :)

# Prerequisites for understanding Bitcoin

## Financial scams and frauds

We are in an industry where two main branches are emerging in the "cryptocurrency" sector:

1. The Bitcoin industry, focused on a sound currency through a decentralized value transfer protocol (Bitcoin). It values privacy and individual sovereignty, and is gradually building long-term projects with a high level of resilience and security.

2. The global cryptocurrency industry, oriented towards fintech, "blockchain", and other centralized innovations. It is evolving rapidly and trying to position itself as the new trend.

The entire focus of this university is on the Bitcoin universe and not on crypto.

![Financial scam and fraud](https://youtu.be/LeyI3CBw2g4)

The cryptocurrency domain, including Bitcoin, remains relatively young and lightly regulated. It is thus rich in various scams. Understanding the dangers and recognizing typical pitfalls is essential. Here are some frequently encountered scam situations:

- Online donations & lotteries
- Pyramid schemes
- Pump & Dump
- Shitcoin groups and influencers
- Deviation / Hard Fork
- Hack
- Fake ransom
- Password scam
- SIM card capture

![scam](assets/prerequis/6.JPG)

In the field of financial investment, pyramid selling and Ponzi schemes stand out as illegal models. They work by using new investors' money to pay old participants. However, their non-sustainable nature and dependence on new arrivals to keep the system running make them likely to inevitably collapse.

![ponzi scheme](assets/prerequis/7.JPG)
These systems are often characterized by dubious elements such as the absence of intrinsic value, promises of unrealistic returns, and marketing tactics that encourage recommendations to attract new investors. Incompressible withdrawal delays and the use of fake profiles on social networks for promotion are also revealing signs of these scams. Given their illegal and immoral nature and the financial risk they represent, it is essential to avoid them.

Ultimately, these systems are doomed to fail. Over time, the requirement for an increasing number of new participants to maintain the system becomes insurmountable. When this point is reached, the illusion dissipates, the system collapses, and investors are often left with no means of recovering their investment.

Ponzi schemes can manifest themselves in various ways. Sometimes, they are disguised as new token offerings or Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), combinations of smart contracts, attempts to monopolize fiat currency, or even marketing programs without a real product. However, thorough investigation and due diligence reveal that these systems create no real value. They simply redistribute money from new entrants to pay old participants.

Recently, the world of cryptocurrencies has seen a wave of projects related to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) that deserve special attention. Some of these projects may use a combination of low-quality cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and interest rate systems to offer supposedly miraculous financial solutions. It is essential to exercise caution and due diligence in the face of these extremely scammy offers.

It should be noted that the content of this course is intended for purely educational purposes and should not be construed as financial advice. The exhortation to "trust but verify" remains an important guideline. It is essential that everyone conducts their own research and makes informed financial decisions.

Pump and Dump (P&D) is a notorious form of financial manipulation that can cause significant disruptions in markets. It is characterized by a coordinated attack aimed at artificially increasing the price of an asset through various mechanisms, such as aggressive marketing, the use of algorithms or artificial intelligence. The goal is to then sell these overvalued assets to realize a profit.

![Pump and dump](assets/prerequis/8.JPG)

The Pump and Dump strategy typically follows a well-defined pattern:

1. An opinion leader or a group of investors first buy a large number of shares or other targeted assets. 2. They then create hype around these assets and disseminate exaggerated or misleading information to attract other investors.
2. This media frenzy triggers FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) among human investors and investment bots, who begin to buy these assets massively.
3. Once the price has risen sufficiently, the leaders sell their assets in bulk, thus realizing a considerable profit.
4. The massive sale leads to a sharp drop in the asset price, leaving many investors with substantial losses.

It is essential to understand that participating in such strategies is illegal and can result in market manipulation charges. In addition, these strategies are often orchestrated by influential groups that charge membership fees. While some participants may realize short-term gains, Pump and Dump strategies are generally unprofitable in the long run.
It is therefore recommended to focus on financial education and responsible investing, rather than being seduced by such manipulative tactics. Acquiring solid knowledge and adopting a long-term approach are essential keys to success in the investment world.

Scams related to online contests or donations are very common in the crypto sector. Advertisements promising free bitcoins are often used to deceive inexperienced users. Key principles to keep in mind are never to send bitcoins with the expectation of receiving them back and to be wary of promises of unrealistic returns. It is essential not to blindly trust, especially when it comes to an internet banner.

A classic example of this type of scam is the offer that claims to double or multiply the bitcoins you send in an exaggerated way. It is important to understand that there is no magic solution to become rich instantly.

![donation scam](assets/prerequis/9.JPG)

Another commonly used tactic is the donation of "shitcoins," or low-value cryptocurrencies. Some centralized cryptocurrency projects will do a lot of marketing and offer free tokens as a gift. One must be very cautious about these offers, as either the token has no value, or the gift is simply used to attract attention and promote trading, gambling, and other scams. Even if these offers are not always fraudulent, illegal, or misleading, vigilance is still required.
On Twitter, for example, bots can impersonate famous personalities and offer incredible deals to deceive people. These accounts use the same name and profile pictures as the personality in question, and can thus deceive less savvy users. Always make sure to verify the legitimacy of the account before interacting with it.

It is also important to be careful with links sent by email. Always check the link before clicking on it and pay attention to the identity of the sender.

Finally, here are some tips to avoid online scams:

- Honest people will never ask you to send money directly.
- Never send bitcoins to an unknown address.
- Promises of unrealistic returns are always suspicious.
- Contests are likely to be rigged.
- You will always earn more by learning than by playing.
- If in doubt, do not act immediately. Take the time to think and do research. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) can be your worst enemy.
  Always remember to do your own research before making an investment decision.

Bitcoin has undergone several "hard forks" over time, giving rise to various alternative versions of the original currency. These deviations are often the work of developers seeking to make significant changes to the Bitcoin protocol, or sometimes of malicious individuals seeking to deceive naive investors. It is essential to distinguish the true Bitcoin from these derivatives to avoid falling into potential traps. Notable examples of these deviations include Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV). Despite bearing the name "Bitcoin," these projects are primarily based on marketing and false advertising tactics to attract investor attention.

![donation scam](assets/prerequis/10.JPG)

A popular saying in the investment world goes: "If it looks like a scam, behaves like a scam, and guarantees that it's not a scam, then it's likely a scam."

It should be noted that some of these deviations are very well-funded and spend heavily on communication to deceive users. For example, the website "Bitcoin.com" is associated with Bitcoin Cash, not the original Bitcoin, which can be confusing for novices. The official Bitcoin website is "bitcoin.org."

The world of cryptocurrencies is a fertile ground for all kinds of personalities, attracted by the potential for significant gains. Among them, unfortunately, are malicious individuals who resort to various tactics to deceive and scam investors.
These tactics may include openly promoting pyramid sales, impersonating Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, plagiarizing the work of others, or making false promises. Additionally, some of these individuals create useless cryptocurrency tokens and Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) in order to deceive investors.

The Bitcoin community often mobilizes to denounce these acts, but it may take some time before the legal system can take action against these individuals.

It is therefore crucial to remain vigilant and exercise discernment in your interactions with the world of cryptocurrencies. My personal advice would be to ignore these individuals and practices. They do not deserve your time or energy. Instead, devote these resources to acquiring knowledge and understanding the cryptocurrency market in order to navigate it in an informed and secure manner.

It is essential to approach "crypto-influencers" or "gurus" of cryptocurrency with caution. These individuals often have personal agendas and may be involved in many projects that they will seek to promote, even if they are not always in the interest of investors.

These influencers may try to promote unreliable or "shitcoins" cryptocurrencies and implement various strategies to increase the value of their investments, even if they are unsafe or potentially fraudulent.

Here are some tips for navigating this environment:

- Beware of anyone who promotes a specific cryptocurrency or offers you transactions.
- "Free advice" is often not really free and may hide other intentions.
- Think twice before paying for trading education. There are many free resources available to help you understand the cryptocurrency market (for example, the YouTube channel 'ukspreadbetting').
- It is not possible to simply copy someone else's transactions and hope to get the same results.
- Remember that just because someone says something doesn't necessarily make it true.

The best way to protect yourself is to conduct your own research and verify sources of information. Watching a video on YouTube is not enough to verify sources.

It is important to note that everyone has an agenda, including myself. I believe in Bitcoin and my goal is to promote it. I hope to profit from this promotion, both politically and financially. No content is ever completely free - if a product or service seems free, it's probably because you are the product.
Always keep in mind that not everyone will necessarily be transparent about their intentions. Always question the purpose of someone's actions and do not blindly trust them.

## Online Security

![online security](https://youtu.be/d9Ccy17yWB0)

In addition to cryptocurrency and financial scams, the primary reason for losing bitcoins is related to poor online security management. It often happens that people use the same password for all their accounts, forget to update their computer, and neglect to regularly back up their data. If you are concerned about these practices, don't worry, it is always possible to improve your online security habits. Here are some basic measures to put in place:

- Use a password manager (see the LastPass tutorial),
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA),
- Keep your computer up to date and free of malware,
- Value your privacy by using dedicated tools (Signal, Tor, ProtonMail).

If this topic is completely unknown to you, the SECU 101 training may be interesting to delve into in detail.

It is crucial to keep your computer in optimal working condition, whether you are interested in Bitcoin or not. An update is not only there to add new features: it also fixes bugs and improves the security of your software. So make sure to:

- Always update your software,
- Use reliable antivirus software,
- Be vigilant when downloading files,
- Regularly back up your data,
- Never share your passwords.

An additional tip: consider buying an external hard drive and perform a full backup of your important files. This could prove invaluable in case of a computer failure.

A password manager is software that stores and manages your passwords. It helps you never to use the same password twice, choose complex and secure passwords, and facilitates your online security management. You only have to remember one master password. This is a free tool that everyone should take advantage of. You can start using it gradually and once you get used to it, you will find it extremely convenient and easy to use.

![password manager](assets/prerequis/12.JPG)
2FA provides an additional layer of security to your most sensitive accounts, whether they are cryptocurrency platforms, Google/Email accounts, banks, or online shopping sites. A second identification, usually a 6-digit code accessible from your phone, is required to log in. Remember to keep a backup copy of the key somewhere in case you lose your phone.
![password manager](assets/prerequis/3.JPG)
![password manager](assets/prerequis/4.JPG)

A VPN, or virtual private network, protects your privacy by masking your IP address. While it doesn't make you completely anonymous, it is still a simple and effective step to improve your online privacy. Choosing a VPN, downloading it, and using it is an easy process to set up.

Online anonymity is essential for a free and prosperous society. It allows for freedom of expression, witness protection, and innovation. Privacy is a fundamental human right. To continue protecting your privacy, consider using:

- PGP for your emails,
- Signal for your messages,
- Firefox or TOR for your browsing,
- Sync for file sharing,
- Bitlocker to encrypt your data,
- Samurai Wallet for money transfers.

Once again, if you are interested in this topic, the SECU 101 training is available to guide you.

## Tips for beginners

![Beginner's advice](https://youtu.be/juMUJ3MWeZY)

Formal education teaches us little about investing. As a result, we often venture alone into this new and complex investment landscape.

In this section, we will look at some common mistakes that beginner investors make when entering the world of Bitcoin, and how you can avoid falling into the same traps. We will also discuss how to plan your Bitcoin investment wisely. The topics we will cover include:

- Being careful with "Shitcoins" or other cryptocurrencies with no intrinsic value.
- Investing only what you can afford to lose.
- Understanding the difference between trading and investing.
- Being aware of tax implications.
- Properly managing your private key.
- The importance of staying humble and discreet.
- Adopting a long-term perspective.

![password manager](assets/prerequis/0.JPG)

Before diving into Bitcoin investment, it is essential to take the time to educate yourself.
It is easy to make mistakes in the Bitcoin industry, and each mistake can be costly. By sharing some of the pitfalls I have encountered in my investor journey, as well as those I have observed in others, I hope to provide valuable advice for navigating this space. Some of these mistakes include:

| Technological Problems                                 | Financial Problems                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Loss of a private key                                  | Overinvestment                                                 |
| Entrusting the custody of your assets to a third party | Lack of financial education                                    |
| Lack of confidentiality                                | Investing with borrowed money                                  |
| Online security issues                                 | Not understanding the difference between trading and investing |
| Mishandling                                            | Ignoring tax implications                                      |
| Computer problems                                      | Not considering investment timelines                           |
| Loss of BTC due to hacking                             | Falling for financial fraud and scams                          |

Regardless of your level of education or background, anyone can understand and use Bitcoin. You don't need to have experience in finance or coding. Like 90% of people, you can simply use Bitcoin in a straightforward way.

Everyone is different and should adapt their investment strategy to their personal financial situation. Here are some good and bad practices:

- Regular average purchases are a good practice.
- Using leverage, such as borrowing money to invest, is generally not recommended.
- Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), or the fear of missing out on an opportunity. This can lead to impulsive investments.
- Allocating a specific budget for your investment is a good practice.

The goal is not to have a perfect plan, but rather to have a structure to follow and adhere to. You don't want to buy on emotion or fear. You want to follow a strategy that you have previously written down on paper to avoid any unnecessary stress.

There is no age to learn how to invest; you can start with a very small amount and progress over time. Education is a journey.

- Golden rule #1 of investing: never invest more than you can afford to lose! The idea is to take all your monthly income, deduct your mandatory expenses (debts and other monthly expenses like housing), deduct your living costs (food). You are then left with your savings budget. If you invest more than that, sooner or later, you will encounter problems!
- Investment Golden Rule #2: Avoid what's trendy. Focus on making rational decisions and progressing. If you have doubts, sleep on it and talk to your loved ones. It's better to take your time than to rush. The best strategy is to progress step by step.
- Investment Golden Rule #3: Planning and having a long-term vision are essential for success in finance. Plan and don't take too many risks. The goal is to avoid fatal failures while accumulating successes.

When in doubt: Start by educating yourself. Explore the world of Bitcoin for a few hours (there are plenty of resources available on this platform). Read 2 or 3 books. Buy €5 to try it out. Watch documentaries and videos. Keep an open mind.

As with any investment, you need to know your market. Bitcoin is very young and volatile, which means things change quickly and there is a certain risk involved. Bitcoin can disappear, drop to 0, or stagnate for years. Therefore, you should only invest what you can afford to lose! Don't go into debt to invest in a currency whose ins and outs you may not yet fully understand.

Once you are more comfortable with Bitcoin, you can review your action plan. Similarly, if you are new to this world, it is important to understand the differences between trading, long-term investment, and a very, very long-term strategy used by many Bitcoiners, called "hold."

In general:

|                  | Trading    | Investment        | Holding        |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Leverage         | Yes        | No                | No             |
| Timeframe        | Short-term | Short/medium-term | Very long-term |
| Asset type       | Contract   | BTC               | BTC            |
| Risk             | Very high  | High              | High           |
| Difficulty       | Very hard  | Hard              | Hard           |
| Learning curve   | Long       | Long              | Long           |
| Potential losses | Unlimited  | Limited           | Limited        |
| Best suited for  | Some       | Most              | Some           |

And here are my tips:

- Opting for a long-term perspective is often a wise strategy. Constantly following the market can be complex and requires full-time commitment. As Warren Buffet said: "If you aren't willing to own a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes."
- It is essential to be extremely vigilant when it comes to taxation: Each country has its own laws regarding Bitcoins. It is essential to research the legislation in force in your country, especially regarding tax obligations. Poor planning could lead you to owe more money to the tax authorities than what you have earned.
  ![taxation](assets/prerequis/5.JPG)

Learning to invest is not something that is generally taught in school. Therefore, many people consider investing to be a risky, crazy, and inaccessible activity. To protect themselves, many people turn to a banker... which can turn out to be a mistake.

There is no age to start educating oneself about investment and understanding how money and the financial system work. It is not necessary to immerse oneself completely; having an overview is enough to make adequate decisions based on facts and not on ignorance. This can be very useful throughout your life, as you will be able to recognize when someone is trying to sell you a bad investment product (such as a bank).

You should not do trading. Yeah, trading is a full-time job that involves a lot of stress, risks, and self-control. It is not an activity for everyone and can involve serious risks. If you still want to try, then at least follow a trustworthy and sensible person, like Mark at Ukspreadbetting.

Two good resources:

- Rich Dad, Poor Dad – Robert T Kiyosaki - This is a good first introduction to the world of investment. It's perfect for everyone.
- The Investors Podcast- This podcast is more technical, but it will give you a good idea of the degree of complexity of the finance world. If you already work in the finance industry or are passionate about it, listen to some of their episodes. Some of them talk about Bitcoin.

To conclude this section on prerequisites, let's go back to the first reason for financial loss in our industry: poor management of the private key.

As a reminder, the private key is a list of 24 words that represents the backup of your Bitcoins. It is essential to exercise extreme caution in this regard. When you store your Bitcoins on an exchange platform, it is the platform that controls them, not you! This situation carries risks such as the bankruptcy of the platform, the confiscation of your Bitcoins, or the hacking of the platform.

The Golden Rule of Bitcoin #1: Not Your Key, Not Your Bitcoins

The key in Bitcoin represents ownership of the Bitcoins. If you hold your key, you regain your financial sovereignty and are responsible for the security of your own money. If you lose your key, you also lose your money. It is best to follow industry best practices and avoid complex strategies. Bitcoin is already risky enough in itself. Listen to the advice of experts. Additionally, when using Bitcoin, it is best to remain discreet: avoid talking about it. By exposing yourself, you would become a potential target, thus increasing the risks for yourself and your family. The best security lies in discretion. There is no need to proclaim to everyone that you hold Bitcoins.

Good luck! I hope you will follow me into the world of Bitcoin and allow me to guide you in acquiring and securing your first Bitcoins without taking risks!

# Understanding What We're Getting Into

## Bitcoin in 5 minutes

In this course, we want to focus on the action plan for obtaining your first bitcoins. If you want a thorough explanation of the fundamentals of Bitcoin, we recommend BTC 101, available for free on this platform.

Bitcoin is a computer protocol that allows value to be sent around the world without a trusted intermediary. This value is represented by a currency called Bitcoin.

The famous Bitcoin that you hear about all the time is therefore this digital currency. Bitcoin users send bitcoins between wallets, and all of this works thanks to a network of nodes (Bitcoin servers) that propagate transactions from all users to each other. To ensure the finality of transactions, some actors in this network are also miners (the famous miners), and their goal is to record the propagated transactions in the Bitcoin blockchain (even more famous).

![in a nutshell](assets/section2/6.JPG)

Thanks to this rather bizarre mechanism, we obtain a database (the blockchain) that is immutable over time, decentralized in space, and that works continuously everywhere in the world. This allows, for the first time in human history, to have a triple-entry accounting system that allows anyone to use an alternative financial system built on the Internet without anyone to control or destroy it.

![in a nutshell](assets/section2/8.JPG)

In addition to its technical functioning (BTC 101 explains it), we can note two characteristics that make Bitcoin what it is today after 14 years of existence:

- The first is that the code for Bitcoin is open source. This means that anyone can look at how Bitcoin works, it is transparent and therefore auditable. Consequently, anyone can use it and the protocol is equal for all, no discrimination can exist. This makes Bitcoin extremely interesting for use as a value transfer system. - The second element lies in its monetary properties. Indeed, Bitcoin is scarce. There will only be 21 million in the world and never more (and even less due to losses). This is possible thanks to the very nature of the protocol, because from its launch, its monetary characteristics (the distribution curve of bitcoins) were decided and no one can unilaterally change them. This characteristic means that Bitcoin, like gold, cannot be diluted by excessive monetary printing.

![in a nutshell](assets/section2/9.JPG)

These two characteristics make Bitcoin a powerful technological and monetary tool that not only innovates in our world, but also breaks norms.

Because of these characteristics, many bitcoiners, including myself, are willing to say that Bitcoin is a major innovation for our society, on the same level as the wheel, double-entry accounting, electricity, or the Internet.

Bitcoin is therefore a "0 to 1" that comes to disrupt our norms and habits.
If this is new to you, I strongly encourage you to follow BTC 101 before continuing to expose yourself to a technology whose role and raison d'être you may not understand well.

![in a nutshell](assets/section2/10.JPG)

## Why is Bitcoin matter?

![why is bitcoin so important](https://youtu.be/Iq0wZF3Ui9A)

Why is the importance of Bitcoin so crucial? This is the central question of this university. Whether it concerns your studies or your investment strategy, without a clear understanding of the importance of Bitcoin, you risk deviating from your action plan. The goal is therefore to always keep in mind the fundamentals of Bitcoin, in order to ensure that your strategy remains in line with your convictions.

Barack Obama once described Bitcoin as "a Swiss bank in your pocket". And indeed, Bitcoin offers the same opportunities to everyone, regardless of who you are. Whether you are a teenager, a president, a protester in Hong Kong or a "yellow vest" in France, everyone has identical access to the same protocol and tools:

1. Creation of free and unlimited accounts.
2. Possibility to send money anywhere and to anyone.
3. No need for identification or paperwork.
4. Accessibility for all, regardless of age, gender, religion, country or income level.

## 5. Confidentiality and transparency on demand. 6. Absence of intermediaries or hidden fees.

7. Bitcoin is native to the internet, making it accessible to anyone with web access.

![in a nutshell](assets/section2/1.JPG)

In short, Bitcoin can be considered the "currency of the people."
Philosophical question of the day: In the world of Bitcoin, two ideologies are facing each other. Do you want to bring the billions of people who are not in the banking system into it? Or do you want to take the billions of people who are in the banking system out of it?

This question deserves reflection, and we will come back to it later.

Billions of people live under the harmful effects of poorly managed monetary policies, which often lead to serious financial crises in the long term. These types of crises have arisen hundreds of times in our history and will continue to do so as long as the value of money and time is manipulated. These crises can manifest themselves in the form of hyperinflation, monetary control, and currency devaluation.

![in a nutshell](assets/section2/2.JPG)

Bitcoin offers every individual a chance to exit this system. It is an ethical choice that everyone will probably have to make one day. Bitcoin facilitates the transition from fiat money to sound money, thanks to its resistance to censorship, divisibility, and portability.

**Did you know**? Over the past 100 years, there have been more than 55 cases of hyperinflation. Most have completely destroyed their country's economy, devastated citizens' economies, and sometimes created political instability that led to the establishment of a dictatorial regime (as was the case in Chile, Germany, etc.). The destruction of fiat currencies is not a new phenomenon and will continue to occur. However, thanks to Bitcoin, you now have the opportunity to exit this system.

![in a nutshell](assets/section2/3.JPG)

The worsening of wealth inequalities in the world has led to a rise in extremism, which has sometimes led to the establishment of dictatorial regimes. No matter who you are, one day you may need privacy to protect your family, yourself, and your savings. Where could you hide your assets if you were politically threatened?

- Your bank account can be frozen, seized, or emptied.
- Gold is difficult to divide, complicated to transport and use.
- Cash is bulky, easy to steal, and subject to inflation.
  Bitcoin offers a solution to these problems by allowing people to secure their savings and transport them without any control from the state. Nearly half of the world's population lives under a hostile regime, and these people need Bitcoin more than anyone else. Bitcoin is a form of passive protest against the injustice of the system.

Did you know? Bitcoin is pseudonymous. An anonymous address is used to store and exchange Bitcoins between users. However, each transaction is recorded in a public ledger (the blockchain) so that everyone can verify it. This means that while users' names are not disclosed, the history of their transactions is entirely transparent.

Central banks continue to dilute your purchasing power through inflation and monetary creation policies (quantitative easing). These are hidden taxes that have gradually destroyed the value of money over the decades. If you do not have a solid income from dividends, bonds, or real estate investments, you will become poorer over time, while the rich will continue to get richer. Due to the actions of central banks, a dollar today is worth less than a dollar tomorrow.

The system encourages you to go into debt, spend, and enrich bankers through interest paid over many years of repayment and indebtedness. This is not a mistake but a deliberate strategy put in place by bankers and politicians to stimulate government spending, economic growth, and push the population to become more indebted.

Our system is corrupted by central banks. Bitcoin is the remedy.

There will never be more than 21 million bitcoins, and no politician, banker, or other malicious individual can change that. This limit was established in the Bitcoin protocol by Satoshi and cannot be changed today. This sets Bitcoin's inflation rate for the next 100 years.

In the past, gold played a regulatory role as a sound currency. However, since 1971, no fiat currency (euro, dollars, etc.) has been tied to gold, which has opened the way to unlimited monetary creation. Brrrrrr (alluding to the sound of the printing press).
If you have money in a bank account, that money no longer belongs to you. In reality, you have lent that money to the bank so that it can use it. It is crucial to understand and become aware of this reality. If you have money in a bank account, you are actually a creditor of the bank. This means two things:

1. If the bank goes bankrupt, you risk losing your money.
2. If the bank refuses to return your money, you also risk losing it.

You may think that these scenarios are unlikely, but we will explore in a later chapter why they are almost inevitable.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is an open and incorruptible system. The rules are fixed and the same for everyone. The famous phrase "Not your keys, not your Bitcoin" emphasizes the importance of owning the private key to a Bitcoin wallet. By owning the private key, you have total control over the Bitcoins it contains. If you do not hold this key, it means that someone else holds your Bitcoins for you. In this case, your Bitcoins are exposed to risks similar to those associated with a traditional bank.

To regain your sovereignty, it is essential to take control of your private key and secure your Bitcoins yourself.

Bitcoin offers a powerful alternative to traditional financial systems. It allows everyone to preserve their privacy, protect themselves against inflation and monetary devaluation, bypass authoritarian regimes, and regain sovereignty over their money. Bitcoin is a healthy currency, accessible to all regardless of age, gender, religion, or income. By adopting Bitcoin, individuals can save for the future, free themselves from the grip of central banks, and regain control of their financial lives. It is a tool that allows for rebalancing of power and promoting economic freedom on a global scale.

Bitcoin, a political movement?
The main promoters of Bitcoin today are still primarily cyberpunks, oppressed citizens, anarchists, followers of the Austrian school of economics, computer engineers, financiers, and advocates of freedom of expression.

## Understanding the Bitcoin Industry

![Understanding the Bitcoin Industry](https://youtu.be/fcXvjghA-uM)

Bitcoin has a highly philosophical, ethical, and political dimension while being completely indifferent to these considerations. Indeed, Bitcoin is a simple protocol that reproduces the same process over and over again. It is its users who have made it a weapon of liberation against the current financial system. From a Cyberpunk perspective, Bitcoin opposes a cashless society. It allows for fully private and intermediary-free digital financial transactions. For the Cyberpunk movement, Bitcoin is the electronic equivalent of cash.

With the arrival of Bitcoin in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, a multi-billion dollar industry was born. Despite its youth, this industry has experienced exponential growth over the past decade. New players arrive every day with large sums of money and are ready to forcefully enter this new industry. Today, the industry has reached a point of no return where governments, banks, internet giants, or others have joined the movement with all sorts of interventions.

Bitcoin is a 0 to 1. It cannot be undone. Some will see it as evil personified, the Pandora's box is open and it now takes away their power and advantage. They will fight it. Others will see in Bitcoin an opportunity to regain freedom, change the system, and improve our society. They will embrace it. Bitcoin doesn't care, it simply exists.

![Industry](assets/industry/2.JPG)

In this section, we will take a quick tour of the actors to better understand how the industry we are trying to enter works.

It is possible for anyone to conceive their own cryptocurrency - a task that only takes a few minutes. However, the value of this token will be exclusively determined by the market. In December 2019, more than 5000 tokens were listed on Coinmarketcap. Today, in 2023, this number has risen to over 23,000, with NFTs, DeFi, and many other things. These cryptographic tokens can take different forms: currency, security token, fuel for an ecosystem, sidechain, digital art, etc.
It is crucial to understand that 99.8% of these new "cryptocurrencies" are scams, set up by marketers with the aim of stealing your bitcoins. However, among the rare 0.2% of serious projects, a significant effort is made to advance, experiment and develop innovative technologies capable of bringing many benefits to users. Over time, the sector will improve, giving rise to legitimate companies offering real products. The question of whether this will happen on blockchains other than Bitcoin remains open. For now, one thing is certain: Bitcoin is the only truly decentralized, censorship-resistant, free and serious cryptocurrency that justifies thousands of hours of work.

| Characteristic   | Bitcoin                  | Alt-Coin (99.9% of them) |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Liquidity        | High                     | Low                      |
| Adoption (real)  | High and global          | Low                      |
| Team             | Robust and decentralized | Weak and centralized     |
| Reputation       | High and global          | Low                      |
| Infrastructure   | Robust and stable        | Weak                     |
| Decentralization | Yes                      | No                       |
| Scam?            | No                       | Probably                 |
| Value?           | Yes                      | Debatable                |

Don't fall for phrases like:

- "Blockchain, not Bitcoin"
- "XRP is the new Bitcoin"
- "StableCoin is the future"
- "Libra will eliminate Bitcoin"
- "Discover my new improved Bitcoin"
- "Fedcoin will make Bitcoin obsolete"

It is essential to do personal research if you decide to dive into the world of alt-coins, but we will not guide you here.

Following the ICO bubble of 2017, many major players began developing their own databases using the "blockchain". Governments and central banks are exploring the possibility of creating a digital version of their fiat currency (Sweden, Europe, Russia, China, etc.). Tech giants are also joining this race. Facebook has launched its own stablecoin project called "Libra". Alternatives to the "blockchain" are being experimented with by banks, corporations, and other tech giants with solutions like Linux or IBM "Hyperledger".

| Characteristic       | Bitcoin | Alt-coin | Facebook-coin | Fed-coin |
| -------------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Public               | Yes     | Varies   | No            | No       |
| Open                 | Yes     | Varies   | No            | No       |
| Borderless           | Yes     | Varies   | No            | No       |
| Neutral              | Yes     | Varies   | No            | No       |
| Censorship-resistant | Yes     | Varies   | No            | No       |

While claiming to compete with Bitcoin, these projects remain centralized in order to ensure control and comply with local regulations. They will not provide privacy protection, but rather increased mass surveillance. Facebook's "Libra" project positioned itself in competition with banks, not Bitcoin. Furthermore, without proof of work, a "blockchain" has no real value. It should be noted that Libra has since been abandoned and no true private blockchain project is currently being used globally, unlike Bitcoin.

![blockchain](assets/industry/1.JPG)

The Bitcoin protocol is beyond the reach of regulations. Only the actors surrounding it can be regulated and, as Bitcoin is decentralized, laws, taxes, and regulations vary from country to country. China, for example, has repeatedly prohibited the use of Bitcoin, while countries like Canada, Switzerland, and Malta have taken a more favorable position towards it. Most nations have set up cryptography task forces to develop new rules and regulations. However, this process is slow and rules can change quite frequently. Despite this slow pace, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are at the heart of many conversations.

![blockchain](assets/industry/3.JPG)

It is recommended to conduct thorough research on the situation in your country. Banks are also highly regulated regarding Bitcoin. Many of them close accounts and limit access to financial services for companies dealing in Bitcoin, while also forming research teams to explore this new technology in order to improve their own infrastructure. No regulator, bank, or government wants to lose power, so they are preparing to face Bitcoin. It is important to note that Bitcoin, as such, cannot be modified or controlled by a single entity.

Exchange platforms serve as a link between fiat currency (government currency) and cryptocurrencies. They give their clients the ability to buy or sell cryptocurrencies through their platform. Each exchange platform has different specificities. Here are some aspects to consider:

- A good reputation for security
- Sufficient liquidity
- Effective customer service
- An intuitive user interface
- An option for automatic purchases
- Automatic withdrawal of Bitcoins to one's wallet.
  Most legal exchange platforms comply with current banking regulations. They have also implemented rigorous KYC ("Know Your Customer") procedures, requiring you to provide identification to create an account. Therefore, the industry of purchasing solutions can be divided into KYC and non-KYC, as we will explore in detail soon.
  ![blockchain](assets/industrie/4.JPG)

**Caution**: "Big Brother" is watching you, supposedly for your safety of course. Your data may be used by your government to track your activities.

In the spectrum of exchange platforms, we can distinguish 5 major types:

- Ethical exchange platform: We are talking here about solutions that try to respect the user by offering a simple and honest service. These platforms generally offer a DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) solution and automatic withdrawal of funds to the user's wallet. These are the most suitable solutions for beginners. (e.g. relai, bull bitcoin, stackinsat)
- Peer-to-peer exchange platforms: They allow you to buy and sell bitcoins directly between users. You can find people in your city to conclude transactions. Be careful during these exchanges and prefer safe and public places to conclude transactions. These non-KYC solutions are very good for slightly advanced users. We explore them in detail in BTC 205; (e.g. Bisq, peach, robosat)
- Altcoin exchange platforms: These platforms allow you to buy and sell the various Altcoins you want to exchange. To do this, you can deposit BTC or use a credit card. It is advisable to be extremely careful with Altcoins and to evaluate their performance in Bitcoin, not in dollars. Basically, these platforms are giant casinos of unregulated assets (often securities). We do not recommend them (Typical example: Bitfinex, kraken, bitstamp)
- Trading exchange platforms: They allow you to trade bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies with leverage, using BTC as collateral. You can thus trade derivative contracts. Be careful if you use leverage! It is probably best not to trade your bitcoins. Similarly, we do not recommend this type of solution for beginners (e.g. Binance)
- Suspicious exchange platforms: Some unregulated platforms are suspicious, they can manipulate their transaction volume and their security is often deficient. These platforms are often Russian, Chinese or exclusively on the darknet. The risk is yours, but it is recommended to avoid them.
  Never forget to withdraw your bitcoins from an exchange platform. Exchange platforms can be hacked, seized, go bankrupt, or simply disappear with your money. They present significant risks and should be avoided as much as possible. Never leave your funds there for a long period of time. Remember: if you don't have the keys, the bitcoins are not yours.

Bitcoins are stored in what is called a "wallet," which is a digital safe for your money. Only the key holder can access it. It can be a hardware device, an application software, or even a piece of paper. These wallets bridge the gap between your bitcoins and the outside world.

Each wallet has different characteristics:

- Privacy
- Security
- Ease of use
- Cost.

In our industry, we can therefore divide wallet actors into several sections:

- Hardware wallet creators. Here we have many companies competing on this subject. Some are open source, others offer hardware wallets that are more or less expensive with more or less features (e.g., Ledger, Trezor, Coinkite, Shiftcrypto).
- Software wallet creators; these are companies or independent actors who want to create software wallets on mobile or computer (e.g., Wizard Sardine, Galoy, Synonyme, Blockstream).
- DIY (Do It Yourself) wallets; here, we have 100% open-source solutions that can be created at home to reduce trust risks in other actors in the production or creation chain (e.g., Seedsigner, Specter DIY).

Wallets are a crucial aspect of Bitcoin, and we will explore them in detail in this university.

Miners are responsible for securing the network. They use electricity to perform Bitcoin's proof-of-work processes, which creates a new block. We have already covered the topic of miners in detail in the BTC 101 course, if needed. To go further, we offer the Mining 201 course.

It is important to understand that this industry is vast, very vast.

While it started out individually, today's miners are generally large, well-funded companies competing in a very difficult sector. They are looking for sources of cheap energy to gain a competitive advantage. They can be public or anonymous and can be located anywhere in the world.

Their industry is divided into many actors of varying sizes:

- Mining hardware creators (e.g., Bitmain): these companies are the essential link in our industry because it is extremely complex to create high-performing ASICs.
- Mining software creators: whether it's for creating mining pools or tools used by ASICs, it's a crucial aspect of the industry (e.g. Braiins OS).
- Developers working on innovative solutions like StratumV2.
- Miners: they are the ones who use machines and software to launch their mining operations. You can find both small amateur miners using an S9 (as we teach in the Mining 201 course) and international miners like Galaxy who own massive warehouses in Texas for mining.

Mining is a whole industry, so if you're interested in the energy topic, you'll be served.

Bitcoin is an open-source protocol. You can find its code on GitHub: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin. From there, you can check all the proposed updates, all the documentation, and many community discussions. Everything is transparent, and it's up to the user to decide whether or not to update. Bitcoin's main developers are responsible for managing this GitHub. They update the source code, check for bugs, and are in charge of the overall project management.

Bitcoin developers can be subdivided into different sections:

- Bitcoin Core developers: they are responsible for the main development of the Bitcoin protocol and its core features.
- Developers of additional protocols (such as the Lightning Network or RGB): they work on additional protocols that integrate into the Bitcoin ecosystem and extend its features.
- Amateur developers who create tools and applications (such as Mempool or Alby): they contribute to the Bitcoin ecosystem by developing tools, services, or applications that facilitate its use.

Anyone can start contributing to the code, but it's important to note that actually modifying Bitcoin's code is a long and complex process. Moreover, many Bitcoin developers are enthusiasts who spend many years developing Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) that may never be used. It's a complex and sometimes unpredictable industry. We'll explore these aspects in detail.

![blockchain](assets/industrie/6.JPG)

Unlimited power? No. The main developers don't have unlimited power and can't modify or control Bitcoin alone. It's the nodes that hold the power. No one controls Bitcoin.

![blockchain](assets/industrie/5.JPG)

## Bitcoin's Layered Architecture

Bitcoin, as an open-source protocol, can be complemented and enriched by layers of protocols/applications added by anyone. Some of these features are more significant than others, creating a dynamic ecosystem with a multitude of companies contributing to the development of the infrastructure. Examples of such projects include Sidechains (e.g., Liquid Chain by Blockstream), the Lightning Network by Lightning Labs, and identity concepts (e.g., Microsoft ION). These projects are like additional layers added to the initial Bitcoin protocol.

Did you know? The internet was not built in one block. It is rather the result of several layers of protocols stacked on top of each other - HTTP, TCP, IP. In this way, each layer is extremely efficient in accomplishing the task specifically assigned to it, while other levels meet other needs.

Lightning is now accessible to everyone, it is Bitcoin's application layer
The Lightning Network is Bitcoin's second layer. It allows Bitcoin to expand and obtain more features. It works like a tab in a bar, where transactions remain on paper and are finalized only at the end. We will study it in detail later.

Finally, it goes without saying that this industry also includes millions of more traditional actors such as companies, merchants, and users.

Today, accepting Bitcoin in one's business has become a simple reality thanks to many tools that do not require much setup time:

- OpenNode
- Swiss Bitcoin Pay
- BTCPay

We have reached a point in the industry where everyone can participate, whether by using Bitcoin in their daily lives by spending it, accepting it in their business, contributing to education or code, or innovating beyond. In short, Bitcoin cannot be stopped.

![blockchain](assets/industry/7.JPG)

The metaphor of the "Bitcoin highway" seems to me to be one of the most accurate illustrations to describe the future of the Bitcoin industry and infrastructure. Bitcoin positions itself as an alternative financial system. Young, maturing, and with its own imperfections, it is nevertheless strong. It will not disappear, and like a black hole, it will absorb everything in its path over time.

BTC can be seen as a road on which you travel. When you need to repair your car, refuel, or buy food, you are forced to leave this BTC road, either to return to the old financial system for your needs.
However, when the infrastructure is sufficiently performant, it will no longer be necessary to leave this road to meet your basic needs. The road will then have transformed into a highway, where 90% of the traffic is at full speed and only 10% slow down or stop. Once Bitcoin has transformed into such a highway, people will no longer leave it to make their purchases. Goods and services will be directly accessible on this highway, and returning to the old system will become rare, risky, and boring.

This is the future vision I have for Bitcoin. It will become a highway for internet traffic and for 90% of the world's population. The old system and infrastructure will not disappear, but they will become obsolete if they do not adapt to the Bitcoin highway.

It was Andreas Antonopoulos, if I'm not mistaken, who introduced me to this idea. @aantonop

# Structuring your plan

Now that we have reviewed the fundamental basics and learned how to avoid scams and losses, we can develop our plan. The plan will be simple enough to start with, but it is important to get started. You can always modify it as time goes on.

In this training, we will assume that you are a beginner in Bitcoin, and therefore the solution must be simple, quick to implement, and effective. We will not discuss exposure to Bitcoin through mining, Bitcoin companies on the stock market, or other complex things. The goal is to choose the right wallet for you, and then the right solution to get your first bitcoins.

Let's start by asking ourselves the following questions:

- How much are you willing to invest in Bitcoin each month?
- What use of Bitcoin do you envisage?
- What is the expected duration of your investment?
- How important is privacy to you?

With these 4 questions, we can choose the path that suits you best! Indeed, there is no magic solution to expose oneself to Bitcoin. Instead, I suggest looking at typical profiles and allowing you to perhaps be inspired.

In general:

- Free hot wallet for small amounts
- Cold wallet for large amounts
- Use of a DCA solution for recurring purchases without stress
- Use of a non-KYC solution for anonymity
- Use of a traditional exchange platform for a one-time purchase.

With this, you should find what suits you, choose the appropriate plan, and then follow the right tutorial in the following section.
**Reminder:** If you do not possess the private key (a list of 24 words), a third party is responsible for the security of your bitcoins. In other words, you no longer hold your bitcoins. They are subject to the same risks as exchange platforms such as hacking, seizure, regulation, or bankruptcy.

## The Hodler

Whether in investments or in Bitcoin, long-term investment is generally the norm. It is statistically the most profitable in the long term and the simplest to implement:

You buy and then do nothing. (Note that doing nothing is the hardest part)

In Bitcoin, this type of profile is called a Hodler, because they "hodl" (hold) Bitcoin for the long term. These people are therefore exposed to Bitcoin, betting that BTC will be more widely used tomorrow and therefore more rare. They will continue to buy it from time to time automatically, all secured in their cold wallet.

![hodl](assets/plan/0.JPG)

Here's the plan:

1. Set up a cold wallet to secure significant amounts.
2. Buy Bitcoin once via an exchange platform and set up a recurring purchase plan.
3. Set up an inheritance plan.
4. Wait 8 years.

If we forget that we had bitcoins for 3 years, no problem, the money will still be there if we followed the experts' instructions.

For this type of profile, it is advisable to use a cold wallet to start with, such as the Bitbox02, Trezor, or Ledger. These devices cost around €70 but offer some security for your bitcoins in the long term. A free hot mobile wallet can also do the job, but only for relatively small amounts.

**NEED:** a cold wallet such as [Coldcard](https://coldcard.com/), [Trezor](https://trezor.io/), [Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/), [Foundation](https://foundationdevices.com/), [Bitbox 02](https://bitcoin.org/en/wallets/hardware/bitbox/), [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/), and an account on an exchange such as [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/) or [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/).

## The Stacker

In Bitcoin, the concept of "Stacker" is quite well known. The idea is simple: there are only 21 million bitcoins, and every little bitcoin counts! This small bitcoin is actually called a satoshi (or SAT). The stacker's goal is to accumulate as many as possible.
To achieve this, he will try to maximize his exposure as much as possible. He will therefore create a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) plan to be able to buy a little every week. This is the best solution to start exposing oneself to Bitcoin without having a significant initial capital. Whether it's €10 per week, €25 per week, or €100 per month, the important thing is to accumulate satoshis without thinking too much about it. His plan will be quite simple:

1. Setting up a hot wallet.
2. Setting up a DCA plan on an exchange platform.
3. Wait and look for other solutions to accumulate satoshis.

Other solutions may include starting to sell goods or services in Bitcoin to accumulate more. Asking friends to reimburse in Bitcoin or getting involved in the ecosystem to be closer to the revolution.

**NEED:** a hot wallet such as [Blue wallet](https://bluewallet.io/), [Green wallet](https://blockstream.com/green/), [Samourai wallet](https://samouraiwallet.com/) and a DCA solution such as [Relai](https://relai.app/), [Swan Bitcoin](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/) or [StackinSat](https://stackinsat.com/). When the amount of accumulated satoshis becomes significant, it is necessary to migrate to a cold wallet.

## The User

Finally, the last type of bitcoiner that can be mentioned in an introductory course is the bitcoiner who needs to use Bitcoin regularly. Whether it is due to a professional obligation or simply a desire to support the ecosystem, it is necessary to provide solutions adapted to frequent use.

For this user, it will probably be necessary to have two types of wallets:

- A cold wallet to securely store bitcoins for the long term.
- A hot wallet to regularly send and receive bitcoins for daily use.

This type of profile will therefore probably opt for a wallet based on the Lightning Network for regular transactions, as well as a hardware wallet for long-term storage.

To expose oneself to Bitcoin, this type of profile will have several options:

- Use peer-to-peer solutions such as Peach to quickly buy or sell bitcoins in a non-KYC manner.
- Use an exchange platform to be able to buy and sell bitcoins regularly according to needs.
  **Requirement:** a lightning wallet like [Phoenix](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) or [Wallet of Satoshi](https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/), a cold wallet like [Coldcard](https://coldcard.com/), [Trezor](https://trezor.io/), [Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/), [Foundation](https://foundationdevices.com/), [Bitbox 02](https://bitcoin.org/en/wallets/hardware/bitbox/), [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/), and a quick buy/sell solution like [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) or [Robosats](https://learn.robosats.com/).

## The Paranoid

I would like to add the paranoid bitcoiner here. This type of person does not want to expose themselves to KYC (Know Your Customer), prefers to remain close to anonymity, and places great importance on their privacy.

For this type of profile, the solution for beginners is quite simple:

- Hot wallet: [Samourai wallet](https://samouraiwallet.com/)
- Cold wallet: [Coldcard](https://coldcard.com/) and/or [Seed Signer](https://seedsigner.com/) (DIY wallet)
- Non-KYC purchase between individuals: [Peach](https://peachbitcoin.com/), [Robosats](https://learn.robosats.com/), [Bisq](https://bisq.network/), [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/)
- Use of Bitcoin ATMs
- Cash purchase during in-person meetings
- Sale of goods in Bitcoin

They will then need to learn how to mix their coins, manage their UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs), and many other things that have not yet been covered in this course. If necessary, all information is available on the university.

# Wallet Tutorial

## Hot Wallet

We will now set up your mobile bitcoin or lightning wallet. As we discussed earlier in the course, this type of wallet is perfect for small amounts or regular use.

### Wallet of Satoshi (Ultra Beginners)

![video tutorial](https://youtu.be/Es4InK3lq5c)

### Phoenix

![phoenix](assets/0.jpeg)

Phoenix is a non-custodial lightning wallet created by Acinq, the team behind the Lightning Eclair implementation.

To find their official documentation, refer to their FAQ guide: https://phoenix.acinq.co/faq

![Phoenix: Bitcoin Lightning Wallet Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx5PK1H5OR0)

### Green Wallet

Its setup is easy, and its interface is designed for beginners.

If you want to take a look at their site, it's just [here](https://blockstream.com/green/)

![green wallet video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lONbCS31am4)

### Samourai Wallet

![cover](assets/tuto/10.jpeg)

Samouraï Wallet is a wallet that focuses on privacy. Despite its warm appearance, it offers a great deal of flexibility in its use and security. As a non-custodial wallet, you will need to back up your 12 words in a safe place and include a passphrase that you must not lose.

Once in the wallet, sending and receiving is done in a conventional way, but with a lot of privacy tools such as **Ricochet**, **Stonewall**, **Whirlpool**, **JoinMarket**, **PayNyms** and others.

To find explanations for each of these tools, you can refer to the **"Privacy Tools"** section in the tutorial or visit the [official Samouraï Wallet documentation site](https://docs.samourai.io/).

[![Rogzy tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVRMAAjNN1w)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVRMAAjNN1w)

[![JohnOnChain tutorial video on mixing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS6iC_ovarQ&t=1s)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS6iC_ovarQ&t=1s)

We have tried to keep the list relatively short to simplify your choice. If you are the type to look at all the solutions before getting started, I invite you to visit the tutorial page of this university to have the complete list of wallets.

## Cold Wallet

As we have seen very often, a cold wallet allows you to secure significant amounts of bitcoins (above approximately €50,000, you should use at least a passphrase or a multi-sig wallet). There are many hardware wallets, here we offer you 3. You can find them all in the tutorial section of this university if needed.

### Trezor Model ONE

![cover](assets/tuto/8.jpeg)

A Trezor physical cold wallet is ideal for getting started in Bitcoin. It's easy to use, not too expensive, and functional.

We have already made tutorials on its use:

1. Setup https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5lWEaaJOE
2. Retrieving bitcoins https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwM0Xm_vSYM
3. Use, send and receive bitcoins https://youtu.be/ks-VHtsqjig

### Ledger Nano S

![cover](assets/tuto/7.jpeg)

![tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vsHNTLi8MQ)

### BitBox02

![cover](assets/tuto/6.jpeg)

The BitBox02 is a Swiss hardware wallet specifically designed to secure your Bitcoins. Here are some of its main features:

![Rogzy tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2Px3qx7vYk)
Although these 3 wallets are among the simplest, there are many others. Here are some quick tutorials:

- Jade: https://youtu.be/_U1jsTeqbTw
- Coldcard: https://youtu.be/FAYmE5-40PQ
- Foundation: https://youtu.be/_uGZHg64wwA

In the world of Bitcoin wallets, there is another concept outside of the distinction between cold and hot wallets, it is the desktop wallet.

If your storage device is actually a keychain (private), the desktop wallet is an interface to use it. It is extremely powerful and convenient for Bitcoin holders, as these solutions offer greater flexibility of use. Indeed, these wallets often allow advanced privacy tools and offer greater flexibility in the use of UTXO. Some even specialize in multi-signature transactions to further enhance your security.

Using solutions such as Sparrow, Specter or Liana is very interesting, but I'll let you discover them later!

# Tutorial for buying bitcoin

## DCA solution (recurring purchase)

In this tutorial section, we will look at how to set up your DCA plan and start simply stacking sats without effort.

### Relai (Switzerland)

![cover](assets/tuto/3.jpeg)

Relai is a very good Bitcoin DCA solution without any hassle. No need for KYC and you have Swiss security behind the project.

![video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAPx1waWa1s)

### Stakin Sat (French)

## Non-KYC solutions

We will not go into the details of this type of solution, as there is an entire training dedicated to non-KYC purchases, which is BTC 205.
Non-KYC is a crucial aspect of your Bitcoin journey and your security. It allows you to expose yourself without revealing too much personal information to a trusted third party. This avoids being compromised with your name, surname, address, and other sensitive information in hacker databases.

If this type of solution interests you, here is a list of solutions that you can find in the tutorial section or BTC 205:

- Robosat
- Peach
- Hodl Hodl
- Bisq

# The Future with Bitcoin

## Creating an Inheritance Plan

Let's imagine the following dramatic scenario.

A car accident, BOOM, you are no longer in this world. You disappear, leaving your family without their Bitcoin expert. They don't know where the money is, but they remember you constantly mentioning terms such as key, word list, and the irreversibility of Bitcoin transactions. They are devastated, bewildered, and now have to figure everything out for themselves. Although this situation may seem terrifying, it is a real possibility that cannot be ignored. You then have two choices: spend between 15 minutes and 1 hour to establish an inheritance plan, or do nothing. No one will judge, but if people depend on you, those 15 minutes could make a big difference one day. It's up to you to decide.

- Option 1: Your loved ones open a letter containing a clear and easy-to-follow plan to safely retrieve all of your crypto assets.
- Option 2: Let your loved ones figure it out for themselves. If they lack a wallet, a market, assets, or compromise a transaction, tough luck for them, the money is lost.

According to Pamela Morgan in "Cryptoasset Inheritance Planning" (page 10), the goals of an inheritance plan are:

- Ensure that your heirs can take possession of your crypto assets in a timely manner, but not before.
- Minimize the risk and possibility of someone stealing your crypto assets before they are handed over to your loved ones.
- Offer your loved ones the option to securely hold the assets, if they wish.
- Avoid conflicts between your heirs and prevent legal problems as much as possible.

**Copyright:** The next lesson is not of my own creation...
Most of the concepts, ideas, and actions proposed in this lesson (6.1 BRH) come from Pamela Morgan's book titled "Cryptoasset Inheritance Planning." This book offers an easy-to-follow, step-by-step process for quickly setting up your Bitcoin succession plan. This process is validated by many industry security experts. While it is an excellent starting point for creating a succession plan, it is NOT legal advice, and you should always (as always) verify sources, confront ideas, and do your own research. Pamela generously allowed me to use her work. I thank her warmly.
![pamela morgan](assets/heritage/0.JPG)

In this lesson, we will focus only on the first part of her book. I will embody the role of a typical Bitcoin user to create his own letter of succession. The process will be simple for now, and we will create a more complex version with different types of profiles later: We will follow Cédric's journey:

- Long-term investor.
- Holder of a physical wallet and a mobile wallet.
- User of a single exchange platform with identity verification (KYC).
- Introduced to Bitcoin by his cousin.
- Does not have smart contracts, Lightning Network (LN), or alt-coins.

### Prerequisites:

I request 30 minutes of your time, not for me or for you, but for your loved ones. Succession planning is a difficult subject, often denied and forgotten. As it is the last task to be accomplished, too many people get distracted and end up foolishly losing all their BTC. So, spend 30 minutes and do it. This is the FINAL STEP!

What do you need?

- A moment of tranquility, without distraction
- 4-5 sheets of white paper
- A pen
- Two envelopes
- A phone/address book
- A computer (in my opinion, this is optional)

![pamela morgan](assets/heritage/1.JPG)

According to Pamela Morgan in "Cryptoasset Inheritance Planning" on page 18, common misconceptions are:

- I need to hire a lawyer.
- I need to trust a third party.
- Planning will make my assets easy to steal.
- The value of my cryptocurrency is too low to be planned.
- My heirs will figure it all out for themselves.
- All of this can be accomplished with a simple smart contract.

### Step 1: Select the right people to help your heirs

It is necessary to designate two people who will help your family when you are no longer there. Thus, your loved ones will have at their disposal a trusted Bitcoin user, up-to-date technologically, on whom they can rely during the recovery process. These people will be able to:

- Provide advice on key and wallet management.
- Help understand how to safely recover your secret phrases (seeds).
- Provide assurance during a transaction.

There will always be a compromise between technical expertise, availability, and trust. If you are unsure who should take on this role, create a simple table to help you decide.

Separation of responsibilities: The trusted person should NEVER have access to your private key. Their unique role is to help your loved ones understand the security system of your Bitcoins and gain confidence. That's why you choose two trusted people. If necessary, you can also use a third-party organization (specialized lawyer or estate planning services).

| Trusted person        | Trust     | BTC knowledge | Contact info            | Note                                                                            |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| My brother Bob        | Very high | Low           | Phone & email           | "Bob doesn't know much about BTC, but we can trust him 100% to help."           |
| My cousin Nathan      | High      | Medium        | Phone & insta           | #1 person to talk to. He can help you. He's aware.                              |
| Ricco (Crypto friend) | Medium    | Very high     | Twitter & email & photo | Trust him on technical questions. Never with money. You'll need to contact him. |
| YouTuber & influencer | Low       | High          | YouTube link            | Educate yourself by following him. He can't help you directly.                  |

### Step 2: Make a simple and quick inventory

It is important to think about all the places where you have dollars or BTC:

- Exchange platforms
- Mobile wallet
- Physical wallet

Consider how you have secured them and where these backups are stored. It is not essential to have two backup locations at this time. The goal is to take an instant snapshot of your CURRENT security. We can improve it later! This is just a first version to ensure your security for now, we will come back to this in more detail later.

| General           | Software / Hardware | Assets       | Location           | Backup (private key)   | Password (PIN, passphrase) |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --------------- | ------------------- | --- | ----- | ---------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Exchange platform | Bitstamp            | BTC & Liquid | Accessible online. | -                      | Home & Bank vault          | This is where I bought and transferred my Bitcoins. I log in using a password manager and 2FA. |
| Physical Wallet   | Trezor model One    | BTC          | Secure             | Uncle Bob & Bank Vault | Home & Mother              | I have two wallets, one normal and one with a passphrase.                                      |     | Samourai Wallet | Mobile – One Plus 6 | BTC | On me | Uncle Bob & Bank Vault | Home & Mother | The app could be in hidden mode. |

DON'T GET DISTRACTED! Do you feel the need to transfer these assets to:

- Improve your security?
- Sell some assets?
- Buy others?

DO NOTHING! You might forget the ongoing project. STAY FOCUSED! You can always review and modify your portfolio later.

### Step 3: Write the letter.

For security reasons, use pen and paper to write a letter to your loved ones.

- I have some crypto
- Contact these advisors
- I have these assets here
- I love you
  Here's a template to help you get started. If you don't want to write the letter yourself, you can download a template and simply fill in the blanks. (link here)

Start by explaining the purpose of the letter and warning your loved ones about the dangers of self-managing crypto.

The letter should be clear and useful. It's not a will, nor a letter to make them cry. It's not a letter to force them never to sell, nor a letter to write down private keys. It's a letter to help them understand what you've done, so they can make the best decision and act safely.

Here's an excerpt from the model letter to a loved one, taken from Appendix E of Pamela Morgan's book, "Cryptoasset Inheritance Planning." To adapt it to our example, I've modified some passages, which I've placed in parentheses and marked in blue. The rest of the text is the original text from the book. (Translated by Discover Bitcoin)

![pamela morgan](assets/heritage/0.JPG)

"Date: 06/26/2020
Dear Liz & Maia,
I love you deeply and I know you will be strong.
I am writing this letter to let you know that I own cryptoassets that may have value.
Please read this letter carefully and in its entirety before taking any action. These assets are different from other assets, because once they are transferred, there is no way to recover them."

Next, we include the "advisors section." This part can be confusing for your heirs, especially if you mention people or organizations they don't know. Be specific about:

- How to contact them
- How to identify them
- What their areas of expertise are.
- How they can educate themselves.
  Below is a list of people I trust to answer your questions and help you in the process of discovering and transferring these assets. Contact the individuals listed, but do not rely on one person to manage the process. Be vigilant with all advisors, including those on this list. Everyone can make mistakes, so make sure you understand what they are doing as best you can and don't be afraid to ask questions and verify the answers for yourself.

Here are the people who can help you answer questions and guide you through this process:

(Insert here the names of your advisors, their affiliation with an organization (if any), their contact information, and how they should verify their identity, for example, key databases, photos.)

- My brother Bob; +33 09 XX 68 18 36; Bobmybrother@gmail.com. You can trust Bob to help you in this process. Although he is not the most technically gifted, he is the right person to question everything and exercise caution to ensure your success safely.
- My cousin Nathan; +33 09 XX 29 35; NathanDeladzcroix@Hotmail.com. Nathan introduced me to Bitcoin. He is very competent in technology and can answer most of your questions. He also owns some bitcoins and can guide you on the technical side. You have seen him several times at family gatherings, and I have included a photo of him here.
- Ricco; @RiccoSFC on Twitter; Ricco425@protonmail.com. I have been working closely with Ricco for many years. You have never met him, so make sure you talk to the right person by asking him "What is Cedric's dog's name?" If he answers "12," it's good. Ricco is a very friendly and competent expert in Bitcoin. He will answer all your questions, and you can rely on his judgment regarding the security of bitcoins. Don't be afraid to contact him; I have met him several times, and he is aware of everything concerning you and Maia.
- It may seem strange, but contact them all. Additionally, you can educate yourself by listening to Andreas Antonopoulos on YouTube and buying Pamela Morgan's book "Cryptoasset Inheritance Planning."

And now, we add the Inventory section. Start by listing your devices and where you hold bitcoins.

- Phone: mobile wallet
- Desktop PC: exchange platforms, applications, games, websites
- Move to physical wallets
- Secret phrase (passphrase)
- Multisig
  When mentioning where the backup is stored, use a general location, not a specific address. If you own anything other than bitcoins, please let it be known.

"Below is a list of devices, software, and wallets I use to access these assets. Please keep all of these devices in a safe place and hold onto them until the assets are transferred to my heirs. Do not let anyone access them unsupervised.

(Insert your inventory of crypto assets here)

- "I used my phone (Samsung Galaxy S8) to access my Samourai wallet. The private key protecting the wallet is stored in the bank vault and another copy is with Uncle Bob. The PIN code to unlock my phone and wallet is kept at home and with my grandmother.
- I use my Dell 2018 computer to access an online exchange platform called Bitstamp. I may still have bitcoins or dollars on this platform. To access my account, you will need to contact them directly or log into my account (be careful, this may be illegal - check your local laws).
- I used a password manager to access it, and you will find my backup in the bank vault. The account is also protected by two-factor authentication, which you can access via my phone (Samsung Galaxy S8) or by using the backup code stored at home.
- I also have BTC on a Trezor Model One device. I access it through my PC and the Trezor.io website. Backup private keys are stored in the bank vault and with Uncle Bob. The PIN code is kept at home and with my mother. The device itself is probably in a safe in my office.
- I use an advanced security passphrase for my Trezor device. The backup of this passphrase is located at home and with my mother."

We will now conclude the letter with some legal information if necessary, as well as some kind words.

"Please note: You will find a copy of my will, dated April 17, 2018, in my document binder. My lawyer, Dwight Schrute, based in Scranton, Pennsylvania, also has a copy. Be careful and always remember my love for you." 06/26/2023, Cedric"

Let's now check our work (From "Cryptoasset Inheritance Planning" by Pamela Morgan, page 44 (translated by Découvre Bitcoin).) :

- Tip: Make sure you have included names, contact information, and if possible, photos.
- Devices: Make sure you have listed your phone, computer, physical wallets, and paper wallets.
- Assets: Make sure you have included a list of your assets.
- Exchanges: Check that you have listed all exchanges that hold funds for you.
- Access: List the information they will need to find your storage location as well as any necessary access codes.

If you have checked all the boxes, then you are ready for the final steps! Make a copy of this letter and keep both copies in an envelope. Seal it, sign the seal, and store this envelope in a safe but accessible place. Make sure your heirs know they need to retrieve this envelope if necessary. Feel free to buy Pamela's book to delve deeper into this subject and plan a time to improve your inheritance plan. Also, discuss it with your notary to legally integrate this plan into your official will.

Congratulations! You have a first version of your inheritance plan, and it's an excellent start!

# Acknowledgments and keep digging the rabbit hole

## Congratulations! YOU ARE IN THE TOP 0.1%

If you have been following our content from the beginning, you are now a true citizen of the 21st century and one of the most seasoned in the Bitcoin field! You use a password manager and two-factor authentication (2FA). You understand what Bitcoin is and why it is important. You own Bitcoins and have a safe way to buy or earn more. You have stored your Bitcoins in a "cold" wallet and have implemented adequate key management. You have created an inheritance plan for your loved ones. You are now safe and can relax! Enjoy a beer and be proud of yourself!

I am really proud that you have reached this stage. I sincerely mean it. What to do next? While you should certainly relax now and be proud of yourself, your journey with Bitcoin is far from over and will never really be. Here are some options for what's next:

1. You could simply continue as you have done so far. Keep accumulating bitcoins little by little and let your strategy unfold over time. You already have a sufficient level of security, everything is in place, and you have done what you needed to do for yourself and your family. You don't need to become an expert in trading, and you don't need to know much more about investing. You probably have a job on the side, and even though Bitcoin is exciting, your main goal was to get to this point. This is the case for the majority of you, and I respect that. I am very happy that you have made it this far down the Bitcoin "rabbit hole," and I hope the journey has been enjoyable. Thank you for trusting me to help you secure your first bitcoins.

2. You may want to continue educating yourself on the technical, ideological, and philosophical aspects of Bitcoin. If you feel like your journey is just beginning, I encourage you to continue learning about Bitcoin. There is so much to learn that it is sometimes difficult to know where to start. Here is a list of courses and training that could accompany you:

- Bitcoin node and Lightning Network: The Lightning Network, as we have seen several times, brings a whole new vision of what Bitcoin is. Through this layer two, the possibilities are multiple and an entire industry is being built on it. To accompany you in the discovery, I invite you to take LN 201 for a theoretical course or LN 202 for a practical course. These two courses are accessible to everyone at this stage of your learning and can help you better understand this new aspect of Bitcoin.
- Austrian economics: If economics and finance are subjects that interest you, then the ECON 201 course is probably the right one to explore the deeper aspects of Austrian economics. There you will discover this economic thought movement that opposes the more traditional Keynesian movement. It's a good start to question our system and understand how we got here from a perspective of inflation and monetary manipulation.
- Merchant solution: Finally, if you are more the type to really want to use Bitcoin, you can go to our tutorials section and explore the many solutions for merchants. This can offer you opportunities in our environment, but also allow you to help your business or friends accept Bitcoin in their commerce and thus run a local economy based on Bitcoin in your city!

In any case, all of our courses are free and many resources or tutorials are available on our platform to accompany you. Good luck with your studies!
