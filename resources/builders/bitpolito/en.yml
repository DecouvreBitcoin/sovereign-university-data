   BitPolito is a student team at the Politecnico di Torino that has become a leading Bitcoin project in Italy. Its mission is to bridge the university world and the Bitcoin industry, fostering a deeper understanding and awareness of Bitcoin over the past four years. The team emphasizes technological and social aspects rather than investment issues, engaging in research, development, and educational activities like conferences, seminars, courses, and events.

   Inspired by the 'Cypherpunk' movement, BitPolito upholds values of freedom, privacy, and open source. It collaborates with various institutional entities and businesses to promote the responsible use of technology. The team actively disseminates educational material through written and visual content and maintains a strong presence on social media, with over 5,000 followers.

   BitPolito has launched initiatives like 'BitGeneration', a lecture series for high school and university students to enhance their knowledge of Bitcoin. The team also focuses on internal training and networking with industry companies. Currently, it has around 50 active members and aims to expand its influence within the European community while maintaining a significant local impact.
