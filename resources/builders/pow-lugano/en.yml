   Lugano serves as the focal point for Plan B Network activities. Our hub, opening in 2024, will offer students, developers, and builders the best of what Plan B Network provides. It's situated in a lively Bitcoin-friendly town that hosts one of the largest Bitcoin conferences each year. Ideally located in the heart of Europe, Lugano is easily accessible to people in the region.

   Plan B Network operates a few hubs worldwide and partners with similar initiatives to bridge gaps within our builder network. Lugano POW is one such hub.
