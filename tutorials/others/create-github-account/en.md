PlanB's mission is to provide top-tier educational resources on Bitcoin, available in as many languages as possible. All content published on the site is open-source and hosted on GitHub, which allows anyone to participate in enriching the platform. Contributions can take various forms: correcting and proofreading existing texts, translating into other languages, updating information, or creating new tutorials not yet available on our site.

If you wish to contribute to the PlanB Network, you will need a GitHub account. In this tutorial, we will guide you step by step on how to create your own account, set it up, and secure it properly.
