- Lightning is a bitcoin payment network that reduces transaction times from minutes to milliseconds and transaction fees from several dollars to a few cents or less. Lightning turns bitcoin from digital gold into digital currency while preserving all of the benefits that make bitcoin great.

- Non-custodial means that Breez doesn’t take possession of users’ money. Many Lightning clients do take possession of their users’ money. They’re basically bitcoin banks. With a non-custodial app like Breez, all users are their own banks. Breez uses a forked version of lnd and Neutrino. The Breez app actually runs a full Lightning node under the hood. Advanced users can interact with the underlying Lightning node by invoking lncli commands in the Preferences> Developers screen.

- Full-service means that Breez takes care of almost all the technical operations automatically and in the background. Things like channel creation, inbound liquidity, and routing stay under the hood. (But Breez is also open source, so those interested in auditing the technology are welcome to do so!)

Breez includes a Point-of-Sale mode, which transforms the app from a Lightning wallet into a Lightning cash register with the slide of a finger, allowing everyone to become a merchant and accept Lightning payments. It also includes a next-generation podcast player, allowing users to stream sats to their favorite content creators.

Note: the app is still in beta and there is a chance your money will be lost. Only use this app if you are willing to take this risk.
