# Creating a Long-Term Backup for Your Bitcoin Wallet

When it comes to backing up a Bitcoin mnemonic phrase, many people opt for paper due to its simplicity. However, it is essential to understand that paper, despite its immediate convenience, has vulnerabilities to elements such as water, fire, and time. An alternative to this is the use of a metallic plate, offering unparalleled durability. This backup method aims to protect your mnemonic phrase, the list of 12 or 24 words that grant access to your wallet, from environmental hazards. In this short tutorial, we will explore step by step how to securely and durably engrave your mnemonic phrase.

While there are different suppliers for these metallic plates, generally each side of the plate is composed of 49 columns: 1 to indicate the corresponding letter and 4 x 12 to define the first 4 letters of the words that make up your mnemonic phrase.
Note that you only need to backup the first 4 letters of your words as no word from the dictionary defined in [BIP 39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) is needed.

## Required Materials

To complete this tutorial, you will need:

- 1 mnemonic phrase (list of 12 or 24 words) from a Bitcoin wallet
- 1 metallic plate that you can purchase from [DecouvreBitcoin's shop](https://shop.decouvrebitcoin.com/products/pack-backup-metal-classique), [Coinkite's store](https://store.coinkite.com/store/seedplate), or [LNBits' shop](https://shop.lnbits.com/product/metal-bitcoin-seed-phrase-backup-plate)
- 1 punch pen
- 1 opaque envelope with a unique identifier

## Steps

1. Take your punch pen and refer to the first column of your first word. Mark the 1st letter by placing the tip of your pen on the corresponding line and pressing down. For example, if my word is "document," I mark the 4th line. Take the time to double-check that the pen tip is properly positioned to avoid any errors.
2. Repeat the same process for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th letters of your word. With the previous example, I would mark the lines "D," "O," "C," and "U."
3. Repeat these steps for the remaining 11 or 23 words that make up your mnemonic phrase.
4. Now that you have marked your backup on the metal plate, perform a final check of all your words, then destroy the paper sheet you used for your old backup.
5. Store your metal backup in a safe place, ideally in an opaque envelope with a unique identifier.
6. It is also preferable to duplicate your backup on a second metal plate and store them in two different secure locations. If you have a Coldcard, you can also use the [SeedXOR](https://seedxor.com/) feature to split your mnemonic phrase into two mnemonic phrases. This method ensures that even if a thief has access to the first plate, they will not be able to access your funds.
7. Regularly check your backup to ensure it is still present and secure, and that the unique identifier on the opaque envelope remains the same.

Congratulations! You have now strengthened the security of your backup. Your mnemonic phrase is ready to withstand the test of time.
