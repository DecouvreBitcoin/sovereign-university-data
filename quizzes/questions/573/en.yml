explanation: |
  The deflation of the 1930s was a result of a credit bubble burst, which
  is a sudden decrease in the availability of credit or a sudden increase in the cost
  of credit. On the other hand, the growth deflation from 1865 to 1896 was due to
  economic growth and increased productivity, which led to a decrease in the general
  price level.
