wrong_answers:
  - For small amounts for personal use
  - For medium amounts for non-profit use
  - For daily expenses for individual use
explanation: |
  A multisig wallet is recommended for large amounts and corporate use
  because it requires multiple signatures to perform a transaction. This adds an extra
  layer of security, as it means that a single person cannot perform a transaction
  without the approval of others.
